  "lyrics": "\nThe days and nights went by, but no one told me\nThey can be fun too, if you only see\nThere’s such a lot of beauty you can live for\nYou only need someone to open up your eyes\nAnd you will see things never seen before\nI see a star, a brand new star\nIt’s right there, twinklin’ in your eyes\nI see a face, a happy face\nIt’s like the mirror of my mind\nI see a star, a brand new star\nIt’s right there, twinklin’ in your eyes\nI see a face, a happy face\nIt’s like the mirror of my mind\nYou opened up my eyes for all the beauty\nThe beauty we’re inhaling every day\nIt’s been there all my life, so it’s my duty\nI won’t lose sight of it, the fire that you lit\nWill keep on burning till the end of time\nI see a star, a brand new star\nIt’s right there, twinklin’ in your eyes\nI see a face, a happy face\nIt’s like the mirror of my mind\nI see a star, a brand new star\nIt’s right there, twinklin’ in your eyes\nHappiness now is being shared by two\nI just started my life anew\nI see a star, a brand new star\nIt’s right there, twinklin’ in your eyes\nI see a face, a happy face\nIt’s like the mirror of my mind\n"
