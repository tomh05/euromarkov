  "lyrics": "\nI once had a love and oh… I loved her very dearly\nShe told me she loved me so, I thought she spoke sincerely\nBut one day, away I found that she had flown\nAnd off to find that love of mine I set alone\nLooking high, high, high, looking low, low, low\nWondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?\nFor if I, I, I don’t find my love, I know\nI shall die, die, die ’cause I love her so\nI journeyed across the sea, I sought her with devotion\nOh, where she could really be? I’ve not the slightest notion\nBut so bright the light of love within me shone\nI knew full well, what e’er befell, I must go on\nLooking high, high, high, looking low, low, low\nWondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?\nFor if I, I, I don’t find my love, I know\nI shall die, die, die ’cause I love her so\nDue east over desert sands, due west where grass is greener\nI asked in a dozen lands but none had ever seen her\nIt was clear, I fear, my quest was all in vain\nSo I departed, sad at heart, for home again\nLooking high, high, high, looking low, low, low\nWondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?\nFor if I, I, I don’t find my love, I know\nI shall die, die, die ’cause I love her so\nBut when I arrived, all brown and tanned by wind and weather\nYou sure could have knocked me down with the proverbial feather\nShe stood there, so fair and sweetly she confessed\nThat she’d been wrong and all along she’d loved me best\nI’d looked high, high, high, I’d looked low, low, low\nWondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?\nNow that I, I, I have found my love, I know\nTill I die, die, die, I will love her so\n(Looking high, high, high, looking low, low, low)\n(Wondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?)\nFor if I, I, I don’t find my love, I know\nI shall die, die, die ’cause I love her so\n(Looking high, high, high)\n"
