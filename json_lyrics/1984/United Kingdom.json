(Baby, baby, why?)\nWhy’d you wanna break my heart, babe?\nYou should have told me from the start, babe\n(You should have told me from the start, oh baby)\nYou should have let me know that you were letting go\nOh why? (Baby, baby, why?)\nWhy’d you wanna break my heart, babe?\nWhen you knew that we were partin’, babe\n(Should have told me we were partin’, baby)\nShould have let me know, you should have told me so\nOh darling…\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games, baby)\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games with my heart)\nYou gave me sugar lovin’ and it stuck like glue\nAnd all this time you had me hooked on you (Baby, baby)\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games, baby)\nYou were only makin’ love pains\n(You were only makin’ love pains with my heart)\nI was just your puppet and you know it’s true\nYou could snap your fingers and I’d run to you (Baby, baby)\nOh why? (Baby, baby, why?)\nWhy’d you wanna break my heart, babe?\nYou should have told me at the start, babe\n(You should have told me, baby, could have told me)\nWhen you knew all the time that you were never mine\nOh why? (Baby, baby, why?)\nWhy’d you wanna break my heart, babe?\nWhen you knew that we would part, babe\n(When you knew that we would part, oh baby)\nThat you would make me cry, that you would say goodbye\nOh darling…\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games, baby)\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games with my heart)\nYou gave me sugar lovin’ and it stuck like glue\nAnd all this time you had me hooked on you (Baby, baby)\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games, baby)\nYou were only makin’ love pains\n(You were only makin’ love pains with my heart)\nI was just your puppet and you know it’s true\nYou could snap your fingers and I’d run to you (Baby, baby)\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games, baby)\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games with my heart)\nYou gave me sugar lovin’ and it stuck like glue\nAnd all this time you had me hooked on you (Baby, baby)\nYou were only playin’ love games\n(You were only playin’ love games, baby)\nYou were only makin’ love pains\n(You were only makin’ love pains with my heart)\nI was just your puppet and you know it’s true\n"
