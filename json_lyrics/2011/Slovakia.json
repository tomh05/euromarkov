Would you battle the ocean?\nWould you give this to lose it all?\nI believe in my life and try to learn every lesson\nNow I see why I fight and I fall\nWhen the road’s not too wide (Not too wide)\nThen trust the heart never lies (Heart never lies)\nNow nothing can touch me, I’ve seen what I can be\nLonely I’ve walked through the fire, but I’m still alive\n(Now nothing can touch me, I’ve seen what I can be) I’m still alive\n(Lonely I’ve walked through the fire)\nIf you lost all meaning, no more truth to believe in\nWould the light inside fade to grey?\nBut if you shine like a diamond, don’t get caught in the moment\nNever letting your breath slip away\nWhen the road’s not too wide (Not too wide)\nThen trust the heart never lies (Heart never lies)\nNow nothing can touch me, I’ve seen what I can be\nLonely I’ve walked through the fire, but I’m still alive\n(Now nothing can touch me, I’ve seen what I can be) I’m still alive\n(Lonely I’ve walked through the fire)\n(Now nothing can touch me) Nothing can touch me\n(I’ve seen what I can be) No no no no no\n(Lonely I’ve walked through the fire) I’m still alive\n(Now nothing can touch me) I’m still alive\n(I’ve seen what I can be) I feel alive\n(Lonely I’ve walked through the fire)\n(Now nothing can touch me) I’m still alive\n(I’ve seen what I can be) I’m still alive\n(Lonely I’ve walked through the fire) But I’m still alive\n\n"
