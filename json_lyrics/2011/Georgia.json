  "lyrics": "\n\nAfter the day I met you there I am not the same\nI try to sleep but nothing helps me feel insane\nPassion game that I play gonna last one more day\nOne more night I’ll be there in my dreams again and again\nI wanna give it on fire, uncover vicious desire\nAbandon painful denial, find every reason to stay\nOne more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare\nDown with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I’m ready to pay\nPay for the hopeless despair\nGonna live one more day of my fate\nHere I am standing with my determination\nI remember when I used to be one of those silly fellows, kind of “really don’t care”\nAnd I realized all my thoughts and all my fears around me\nYou wanted to know what I felt and you got it right there\nTurn around, all the words of regrets\nAnd seize the chance to find the way so I can be raised\nI am too lame, psycho from the brain\nThere is nothing I can do, that’s a part of the game\nOut of such foolish state gonna find no other way\n(Make way, ’cause it’s all about the shame)\nFeel no shame, ’cause I live one more day again\nI wanna give it to fire, uncover vicious desire\nAbandon painful denial, find every reason to stay\nOne more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare\nDown with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I’m ready to pay\nPay for the hopeless despair\n(Turn back in the days when you desired and craved)\n(And all the way you felt just like burned in the flame)\nGonna live one more day of my fate\n(No shame, no way, no play, no brain, no game)\nI wanna give it to fire, uncover vicious desire\nAbandon painful denial, find every reason to stay\nOne more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare\nDown with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I’m ready to pay\nPay for the hopeless despair\nGonna live one more day of my fate\n\n"
