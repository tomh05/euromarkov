  "lyrics": "\n\nLife’s a game, it’s a mystery which we give in to\nDays go by, no lesson learnt, just things that you do\nThings change even in my mind, not in my heart\nI am who I am and I’m here for you\nOne life – show what’s in your heart, love me like I love you\nOne life is all we get to live, time to set your heart free\nChase the pain away, move on and don’t give up\nThis time it’s all up to you, you can love yourself too\nLife is strange and heavenly once you surrender (Surrender)\nLove begins within ourselves and makes up our lives\nHold on to what life brings you, just be who you are\nYou can lead the way too, it’s all up to you\nOne life – show what’s in your heart, love me like I love you\nOne life is we get to live, time to set your heart free\nChase the pain away, move on and don’t give up\nThis time it’s all up to you, you can love yourself too\nDon’t try to judge me, you don’t know how I feel\nLove me, love me for who I am\nMy life, I will give it all, I give it all to you, give it all\nOne life – show what’s in your heart, love me like I love you\nOne life is all we get to live, time to set your heart free\nChase the pain away, move on and don’t give up\nThis time it’s all up to you, you can love yourself too\nIt’s all up to you, you can love yourself too\nIt’s all up to you, you can love yourself too\n\n"
