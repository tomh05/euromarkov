A smile can change it all\nYou gotta make believe and make your dreams come true\nIt ain’t that hard to do, whoa…\n‘Cause I can’t change, I can’t change the world alone\nI need you all, everybody, start dreaming of it\nAnd take your step that’s gonna make a difference\nAnd change your world\nYou gotta make believe, make your dreams come true\nIt ain’t that hard to do, whoa…\nI can’t change, I can’t change the world alone\nI need you all, everybody, start dreaming of it\nTake your step that’s gonna make a difference\nAnd change your world\n(I can’t change the world alone)\n(I need you all) I need you all, everybody\nTake your step and make a difference\nAnd change the world\n(‘Cause I can’t change the world alone)\n(I need you all) I need you all, oh everybody\nTake your step that’s gonna make a difference\nAnd change your world\n\n"
