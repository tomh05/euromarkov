  "lyrics": "\nAwake your heart\nYou fear it, but we’ll make a start\nSeems like the wind just blows your way\nWith clouds full of rain\nAnd you hide, because the world ain’t right\nKnow that your cold and hurtin’ soul\nIs never alone\nDon’t waste your time, just lift your mind\nImagination comes alive\nNow you know that I’ll be by your side\nFeel the risin’ hope and the sky will open\nTake my hand, don’t stall, have faith\nThough the road is long, there are golden gardens\nAt the sweet end of your trail\nLay down now\nI’ll ease your heart, erase your frown\nTo light up the darkness in your dreams\nI will be here\nAnd we’ll find the freedom you left behind\nCapture the sun, the source, it shone\nYou were never alone\nDon’t waste your time, just lift your mind\nImagination comes alive\nNow you know that I’ll be by your side\nFeel the risin’ hope and the sky will open\nTake my hand, don’t stall, have faith\nThough the road is long, there are golden gardens\nAt the sweet end of your trail\nThough the road is long, there are golden gardens\nAt the sweet end of your trail\nAt the sweet end of your trail\n\n"
