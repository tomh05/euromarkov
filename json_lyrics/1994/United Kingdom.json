  "lyrics": "\nWalk into the box, let your secrets out\nTime for confession\nPurify your soul, denounce the devil from within\nNo time for aggression\nCan’t you see the piece of dust\nThat crumbles in your hand is me?\nGive me some affection\nAnd though my heart is broken\nMy picture is forgotten but I still believe\nThat I can see a piece of me reflecting in your eye\n(We will rise)\n(Never fall) Never fall\n(We will be free) And we will be free\n(We will rise) We will rise\n(Never fall again) We’ll never fall again\n(We will be free) And we will be free\nWelcome to the land where all our dreams are planned\nAnd fighting is a thing to do\nSometimes it makes me feel\nNaked like a tree in autumn\nAnd while you dance beneath an angry star\nI’m chasing rainbows across the sun\nAnd in this mad equation I still believe that we can be\nIn harmony, you and me a chorus in your lonely symphony\n(We will rise)\n(Never fall) We’ll never fall\n(We will be free) And we will be free\n(We will rise) We will rise\n(Never fall again) We’ll never fall again\n(We will be free) And we will be free\n(We will rise)\n(Never fall) We’ll never fall\n(We will be free) And we will be free\n(We will rise)\n(Never fall) We’ll never fall\n(We will be free) And we will be free\n(We will rise) We will rise\n(Never fall again) We’ll never fall again\n(We will be free) And we will be free\nWith a little love\n(We will rise) We will be free\n(Never fall again) We’ll never fall\n(We will be free) And we will be free\n"
