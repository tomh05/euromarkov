  "lyrics": "\nThey envy me, my hills of Clare\nThe white gulls calling in the soft sea air\nSo much to lose, and yet I’d leave the hills of Clare\nAnd live in a desert if I had you there\nWhat would I lose if I could choose?\nIf I could choose a place to walk with you\nI’d choose the longest road\nAnd it would lead us to a house that no one knew\nBellows by the fire, and the turf smoke rising higher\nThan the lark that wings and always sings of you\nIf I could choose a time to talk with you\nI’d choose the longest day\nAnd over all the hills of Clare, I’d shout the news\nI would tell them how a day could last forever\nAnd I’d never leave your side if I could choose\nIf I could choose a time to talk with you\nI’d choose the longest day\nAnd over all the hills of Clare, I’d shout the news\nI would tell them how a day could last forever\nAnd I’d never leave your side if I could choose\n"
