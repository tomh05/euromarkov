  "lyrics": "\nShadows fall, it’s so lonely waiting here\nThere’s a garden bare out there, where songbirds sing no more\nNo golden stardust shining and no lining on the cloud\nCould it be you and me have found our rainbow’s end?\nAutumn leaves falling softly all around\nThere ain’t but a single sound of voices I once knew\nNo silver star to follow and no moon to light the way\nCould it be you and me are playing ‘let’s pretend’?\nWon’t you just call me?\nIf I’m to blame at all, I’ll say I’m sorry\nIt’s useless standing tall, I’m longing for your touch\nI’m waiting for a love I knew so well, so well\nWinter cold, and the wind blows through my hair\nDeep inside you know I care, no matter what’s in store\nOur lines of love ain’t rhyming and the rhythm is all gone\nCould it be you and me can’t say we’re on the mend?\nLet’s pretend\nWon’t you just call me?\nIf I’m to blame at all, I’ll say I’m sorry\nIt’s useless standing tall, I’m longing for your touch\nI’m waiting for a love I knew so well, ooh yeah…\nWhoa whoa… won’t you just call me?\nThat’s all I need to hear to ease the worry\nI’ll kiss each lonely tear, to me you mean so much\nGod knows I speak the truth and time will tell\nOoh…\n"
