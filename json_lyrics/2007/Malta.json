Could it be maybe\nSolo is the way to go?\n(And I’m) lost, then I’m found\nAnd I run, then I hide\nAnd I turn, you’re not there\nI say yes, you say no\nLovin’ you gives me vertigo\nAnd I give, but you take\nI made one big mistake\nGave you all, A to Z\nThen you came, now you go\nLovin’ you gives me vertigo\n"
