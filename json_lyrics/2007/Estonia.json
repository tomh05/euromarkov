  "lyrics": "\n\nWe’re standing in the rain\nAnd sipping cold champagne\nThe night is full of angels of sin\nThe demons of pleasure and pain\nYou whisper in my ear\nI’m holding back the tears\nYour words are burning the way to my heart\nThat’s been held hostage for years\nThe wild look in your eyes\nWill light my fire inside\nThis is the night that we cannot deny\nWe’ll always be partners in crime\nI kiss your lips so sweet\nMmm but do you feel the heat?\nIs it so wrong to be hungry for love?\nTo follow the passion so deep?\nThe wild look in your eyes\nWill light my fire inside\nThis is the night that we cannot deny\nWe’ll always be partners in crime\nThe wild look in your eyes\nWill light my fire inside\nThis is the night that we cannot deny\nWe’ll always be partners in crime\nNow it’s too late to turn back the time\nWe just have to go with the flow\nI will be yours and you will be mine\nAnd that’s how the story goes\nThe wild look in your eyes\nWill light my fire inside\nThis is the night that we cannot deny\nWe’ll always be partners in crime\nThe wild look in your eyes\nWill light my fire inside\nThis is the night that we cannot deny\nWe’ll always be partners in crime\nPartners in crime\nPartners in crime\n"
