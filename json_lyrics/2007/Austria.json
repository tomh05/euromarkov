  "lyrics": "\n\nLivin’ in this world – be a little too much\nDon’t let it get you down, get up and strut\nOoh…\nIf you ever get the chance, hold your hand out and take it\nMake a promise to yourself, don’t you break it\nOh, I tried to get up when I was upside down\nGot to find a way to turn my life around\nThis is the time for us to get a life\nOpen your mind to a better life\nThere’s no way of knowin’ where you’re goin’\nGet a life, a better life\nGo outta your way and make some compromise\nHold to your dreams and you will realise\nIf you don’t understand it, don’t take it for granted\nOpen your mind to a better life\nLet’s turn up the heat, start a ripple in the water\nWake the soul from its sleep, no particular order\nCould be wastin’ precious time, free the mind, are you willin’?\nDon’t be afraid, do your dance and start livin’\nI’ve got a vision in mind, I’m doin’ my time\nI’m livin’ my life ’cause I’ve opened my mind\nThis is the time for us to get a life\nOpen your mind to a better life\nThere’s no way of knowin’ where you’re goin’\nGet a life, a better life\nGo outta your way and make some compromise\nHold to your dreams and you will realise\nIf you don’t understand it, don’t take it for granted\nThere’s no way of knowin’ where you’re goin’\nThis is the time for us to get a life\nThis is the time for us to get a life\nOpen your mind to a better life\nThere’s no way of knowin’ where you’re goin’\nGet a life, a better life\nGo outta your way and make some compromise\nHold to your dreams and you will realise\nIf you don’t understand it, don’t take it for granted\nThis is the time to get a life\n(This is the time) to get a life\n(This is the time)\nThis is the time for us to get a life\n"
