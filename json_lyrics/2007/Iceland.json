  "lyrics": "\n\nI’ll let the music play while love lies softly bleeding\nIn heavy hands on shadowlands\nAs thunderclouds roll in, sunset is receding\nNo summer wine, no Valentine\nA tiger trapped inside a cage\nAn actor on an empty stage\nCome see the show\nRock ‘n’ roll can heal your soul\nWhen broken hearts lose all control\nSome rivers still run dry and jungles burn to embers\nGold autumn days must fade to grey\nThere is a reason why a haunted man remembers\nOne frozen night, his darkest day\nA tiger trapped inside a cage\nAn actor on an empty stage\nCome see the show\nRock ‘n’ roll will heal your soul\nWhen broken hearts lose all control\nA passion killed by acid rain\nA rollercoaster in my brain\nBut how would you know?\nIn your satin, silk and lace\nAnother time, another place\nA tiger trapped inside a cage\nAn actor on an empty stage\nCome see the show\nRock ‘n’ roll will heal your soul\nWhen broken hearts lose all control\nA love let loose and painted black\nA train stuck on a broken track\nWell, I’ll let it go\nRock ‘n’ roll has healed my soul\nThe stage is set, on with the show\n"
