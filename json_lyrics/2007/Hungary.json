  "lyrics": "\n\nHow many times have you fooled me and denied that\nIt’s her who you love, and it sure isn’t me?\nSo now that it’s over, I’ll try and take it sober\nLeave questions unasked, remember us laughing at the broken past\nGod, if I could make it on without you\nYou’re such a casual man, oh, wavin’ an empty hand\nI’m helpless and I’m lonely without you\nYes, you’re a casual man, lendin’ an empty hand\nLeft me breathless with nothing more to lose\nI used to dream we’d take it nice and easy\nGet jobs, settle down in Jameson Town\nIf now you could see me, you’d think twice about leaving\nYou said forever is the time you gonna spend around\nSo why did you leave me?\nAnd why should I believe it? – You say goodbye\nOh, why, oh… why you leave me?\nSaid, why?\nYou’re such a casual man, oh, wavin’ an empty hand\nI’m helpless and I’m lonely without you\nYou’re such a casual man, lendin’ an empty hand\nLeft me breathless with nothing more to lose\nCasual man, lendin’ an empty hand\nLeft me breathless with nothing more to lose\nExcept an evanescent unsubstantial blues\n"
