  "lyrics": "\n\nThe curtain has been raised, the wall no longer stands\nAnd from Lisadell to Latvia we’re singing as one clan\nThe curtain has been raised and Europe’s all one stage\nAnd the archipelagic icicles have melted like the cage\nWe don’t need no party, just a party band\nA continental choir singing hand in hand\nThey might scare the blackbird but they cannot stop him sing\nThey may steal the honey but they’ll never steal the sting\nThey may crush the flowers, trample every living thing\nBut they can’t stop the spring\nThey might scare the blackbird but they cannot stop him sing\nThey may steal the honey but they’ll never steal the sting\nThey may crush the flowers and trample every living thing\nBut they can’t stop the spring\nThey might scare the blackbird but they cannot stop him sing\nThey may steal the honey but they’ll never steal the sting\nThey may crush the flowers and trample every living thing\nBut they can’t stop the spring\nNo, they can’t stop the spring\n"
