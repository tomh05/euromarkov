  "lyrics": "\n\nStars in the sky\nWhen the shadows fall, when the sunlight dies\nEmpty streets are filled with the pale lamplight\nWe are just two lonely shades walking in the night\nWords lose their sense\nWhen I feel you near, when I touch your hands\nI’m trying not to think that at break of dawn\nYou’ll be gone and I’ll be lost, numb and all alone\nWhen the morning comes, I’m all alone\nLeft to live another day, in joy or sadness, on my own\nWhen the morning comes, I’m all alone\nEvery time at break of dawn\nWeak and unwise\nI betray all fears that I should disguise\nMelting in your arms, I fail to realise\nWhy the mornings always change the colour of your eyes\nWhen the morning comes, I’m all alone\nEvery time at break of dawn\nLove or leave, I’m with and without you\nHow come I am up to this senseless game?\nHow could I stop thinking about you?\nLove or leave, don’t play with my heart again\nLove or leave, I’m with and without you\nHow come I am up to this senseless game?\nHow could I stop thinking about you?\nHey… love or leave, don’t play with my heart again\n"
