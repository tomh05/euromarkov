  "lyrics": "\n\nA cocoon in a silent tree\nThrough the dark night you listen to me\nWhen I whisper broken words in your ear\nAnd you push, you push me hard to the surface\nI’m blinded at heart, but you wake me\nYou wake me up from the snow where I was born\nNow I can see\nThe whole world is mine\nI can touch and feel\nI feed you my love\nYou put a knife against my back\nAnd you dare me to face the attack\nYou say, “For cowards there’s no reward”\nFeel the heat\nTake my hand, I trust your word\nBring the fire, I don’t care if it hurts\nI have the future on my tongue\nGive me a kiss\nNow I can see\nThe whole world is mine\nI can touch and feel\nSo I feed you my love\nYou put a knife against my back\nAnd you dare me to face the attack\nYou say, “For cowards there’s no reward”\nI have the future on my tongue\nNow I can see\nThe whole world is mine\nI can touch and feel\nSo I feed you my love\nFeed you my love\nSo I feed you my love\n\n"
