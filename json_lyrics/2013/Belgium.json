  "lyrics": "\n\nSo the arrow shot right through her heart and rocked her to the core\nAnd she fell so deep like she had never fell so deep before\nBut the pain was almost unbelievable\nWhen the end was near, she felt the fear alive\nWaiting for the bitter pill\nGive me something I can feel\n‘Cause love kills over and over\nLove kills over and over\nWaiting for the bitter pill\nSomething I can truly feel\n‘Cause love kills over and over\nLove kills over and over again\n‘Cause he didn’t fight for life when he was up against the wall\nAnd he felt so scared for both of them even though they had it all\nThere’s a lesson that you always have to learn\nThrough the consequence of fire comes the burn\nWaiting for the bitter pill\nGive me something I can feel\n‘Cause love kills over and over\nLove kills over and over\nWaiting for the bitter pill\nSomething I can truly feel\n‘Cause love kills over and over\nLove kills over and over again\nOne last, one last, one last breath for life\nWon’t you give me, give me hope tonight\nWaiting for the bitter pill\nGive me something I can feel\nLove kills over and over\nLove kills over and over\nWaiting for the bitter pill\nSomething I can truly feel\n‘Cause love kills over and over\nAnd love kills over and over again\nLove kills over and over\nAnd love kills over and over again\nLove kills over and over\nAnd love kills over and over again\n\n"
