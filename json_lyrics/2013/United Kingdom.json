  "lyrics": "\n\nYou say you don’t believe in signs from up above\nAnd you laugh at the thought of putting your faith in stuff like love\nYou never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain, you say\nYou wanna believe but it’s just not worth the pain today\nBut that’s all fine if that’s how you want it to be\nBut if you’re feeling alone and afraid and you can’t breathe\nBelieve in me, yeah\nBelieve in me, yeah\nBelieve in the way I look at you and stand beside you\nThe way I speak the truth, I’d never lie to you\nIf you’d just believe in the things that your eyes can’t see\nBelieve in me\nYou come and you go and there’s never no compromise, that’s why\nThe seconds and the minutes of your life go crawling by\nBut that’s all fine if that’s how you want it to be\nBut if you’re feeling alone and afraid and you can’t breathe\nBelieve in me, yeah\nBelieve in the way I look at you and stand beside you\nThe way I speak the truth, I’d never lie to you\nIf you’d just believe in the things that your eyes can’t see\nBelieve in me\nWhat ya gonna do when your ship is sinking?\nAnd you’re crying out for help and just the seagulls listening\nIn the dark of the night, in the middle of the fight\nWhen you’re reaching out for something and there’s nothing\nBelieve in me, yeah\nBelieve in the way I look at you and stand beside you\nThe way I speak the truth, I’d never lie to you\nIf you’d just believe in the things that your eyes can’t see\nBelieve in me\n\n"
