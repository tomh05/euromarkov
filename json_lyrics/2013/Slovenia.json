  "lyrics": "\n\nFaster than light, here comes the night\nTomorrow is now\nYou flow through my veins, inside me you’ll stay\nThere is no doubt\nNo one in this world, no diamonds, no pearls\nLike your love divine\nSo high off the ground, we’ll never come down\nNo limit, no sky\nStraight into love, we’ll break through the dawn\nAnd light the world up from the sky when we collide\nStraight into love and never let go\nWe’ll light the world up from the sky into the night\nWe’re turning the tide, with eyes open wide\nThere’s no stopping now\nWith all that we have, we stand on the edge\nBefore we dive down\nStraight into love, we’ll break through the dawn\nAnd light the world up from the sky when we collide\nStraight into love\nWe’ll light the world up from the sky up above\nStraight into love, love\nWe found the place where we belong\nOut of the dark our flame is strong\nWe’re moving fast, we won’t look back\nHigher and higher we go\nStraight into love, oh…\nStraight into love\nStraight into love\nWe’ll light the world up from the sky into the night\n\n"
