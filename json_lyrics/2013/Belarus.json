  "lyrics": "\n\nFriday night was just going nowhere\nSitting in a small café\nFeeling lonely, a little tired\nI’ve been working hard all day\nThen a noise caught all my attention\nAnd I heard a wonderful sound\nComing at me like a tsunami\nNearly took my feet off the ground\nA rush of excitement flowed into my ears\nOh, beautiful people, aha-ia-ia-ia-ia\nSolayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya\nWe play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha\nSolayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it’s gonna getcha\nWe play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night\nSituation started improving\nMaybe this was kismet now\nAnd my body just started moving\nI was really shaking down\nSomething happened when I was dancing\nI could feel that powerful beat\nTaking me to new dimensions\nWaking up the devil in me\nA heavenly chorus and love all around\nOh. beautiful people, aha-ia-ia-ia-ia\nSolayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya\nWe play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha\nSolayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it’s gonna getcha\nWe play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night\n(Cha-cha)\n(A hot night)\nIt feels like I’m dreaming, this word makes no sense\nLets sing it again now, aha\nSolayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya\nWe play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha\nSolayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it’s gonna getcha\nWe play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night\nSolayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya\nWe play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha\nSolayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it’s gonna getcha\nWe play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night\nWe can make it into a cha-cha\n\n"
