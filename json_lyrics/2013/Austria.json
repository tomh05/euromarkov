  "lyrics": "\n\nWhen hurt is all you’re feeling, your heart is slowly bleeding\nThe only memories to hold on to\nWhen you almost stop believing, you’re cold, alone and freezing\nYou think you’re lost and don’t know where to go\nLook up to the starlit sky, reignite the fire\nYou will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky\nYou will shine, I see the light in your eyes\nYou will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky\nOh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes\nTrust me, you will shine\nTime is always healing and answers are revealing\nSometimes they’re simply right before your eyes\nBut when you’re down here kneeling there is no chance to see it\nYou can when all these dark clouds disappear\nLook up to the starlit sky, reignite the fire\nYou will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky\nYou will shine, I see the light in your eyes\nYou will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky\nOh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes\nTrust me, you will shine\nStill alive and breathing\nStill alive and breathing\nStill alive and breathing, still alive and breathing\nStill alive and breathing\nYou will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky\nYou will shine, I see the light in your eyes\nYou will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky\nOh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes\nOh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes\nTrust me, you will shine\n\n"
