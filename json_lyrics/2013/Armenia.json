  "lyrics": "\n\nWho’s the one that starts a war?\nWho’s dictating what is less and more?\nWho can change the night and day?\nWho’s the one with clever face?\nThat can tell us what is in the space?\nPlaying games that none can play\nMaybe someday we’ll break the wall\nMaybe the light will touch us all\nLonely planet, who has done it?\nWho can save you? Who can stop it?\nLonely planet, who has done it?\nWho can save you? Who can stop it?\nWho’s the one that has the right?\nTreat us wrong and tell us what is right?\nBringing crowd against the squad\nWho has honesty to show?\nWho can tell us “I don’t know”?\nWho’s the man and who’s the god?\nMaybe someday we’ll break the wall\nMaybe the light will touch us all\nLonely planet, who has done it?\nWho can save you? Who can stop it?\nLonely planet, who has done it?\nWho can save you? Who can stop it?\nLonely planet, we have done it\nWe can save you, we can stop it\nLonely planet, we have done it\nWe can save you, we can stop it\nWe can stop it, we can stop it\nWe can stop it, we can stop it\nFor the world \n\n"
