  "lyrics": "\n\nShould have seen it coming when I saw you\nShould have had the sense to stop and walk away\nIt was gonna turn out complicated\nWe’ve hit overload, about to explode\nIf love was a mountain\nI’d climb up to the highest of them all\nI’d swim across the ocean if you’d call\nI’m lost in your smile, free-falling for miles\nHold me, just unfold me\nUnchain my soul, give me love, make me whole\nHold me if it’s only\nFor this moment in time, now I’m yours and you’re mine\nSo hold me\nTake a little time and you’ll know better\nThen to think about giving in on the one you love\nHere we’re going back and freeze the moment\nWhen we used to be free, was only you and me\nHold me, just unfold me\nUnchain my soul, give me love, make me whole\nHold me if it’s only\nFor this moment in time, now I’m yours and you’re mine\nRemember how we used to laugh, but now you’re running from the past\nLet’s find the strength to carry on\nRemember how when love used to be, you said I was your fantasy\nCan’t take another night alone, so come on home\nHold me, just unfold me\nUnchain my soul, give me love, make me whole\nHold me if it’s only\nFor this moment in time, now I’m yours and you’re mine\nSo hold me\n\n"
