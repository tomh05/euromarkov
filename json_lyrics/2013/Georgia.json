  "lyrics": "\n\nThere’s no me without you\nDon’t know what I would do\nYou’re my heartbeat, I’m breathing because of you\nThere’s no world without us\nDreams would turn into dust\nYou’re the reason, the reason I make it through\nFeels like I’m flying, like if I had wings\nLike I am sailing on a sea of dreams\nYour love is pouring down on me\nYou’re my waterfall\nIn a moment like this\nI’m in a state of bliss\nI’m swept away, I look into an open sky\nFeels like I’m flying, like if I had wings\nLike I am sailing on a sea of dreams\nYour love is pouring down on me\nYou’re my waterfall\nMy heart is higher than the highest kite\nI feel how all your love surrounds me\nStanding in the waterfall\n(Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams)\nSailing on a sea of dreams\n(Your love is pouring down on me)\nYou’re my waterfall\nFeels like I’m flying, like if I had wings\nLike I am sailing on a sea of dreams\nYour love is pouring down on me\nYou’re my waterfall\n\n"
