  "lyrics": "\nA man without love is only half a man\nAnd half a man is nothing\nA man without love cannot begin to dream\nFor all his dreams lead nowhere\nThat was me, the man I used to be\nA lonely cloud who’d never found his destiny\nThen you came, you touched my heart and told the pain to go\nAnd now I know\nA man who is loved has everything in life\nAnd all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds\nThat he knows never sang\nFor a man without love\nThat was me\nThe man I used to be\nA lonely cloud who’d never found his destiny\nThen you came\nYou touched my heart and told the pain to go\nAnd now I know\nA man who is loved has everything in life\nAnd all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds\nThat he knows never sang\nFor a man without love\n"
