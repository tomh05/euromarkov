Alles klar? – Wunderbar (Come on, merci)\nComment ça va? – Comme ci, comme ça\nDon’t you know you look so fine?\nDon’t you know you blow my mind?\nDon’t you know that you got style?\nI think I’ll make you mine\n(You got style, you got style) Yeah\n(You got style) Baby\nYou got style, you got style\nYou got style (Baby)\nYou got style, baby\nYou got style, you got style\nYou got style (Baby)\nOh… don’t you know?\nYou got style, said, you got style, said\n(You got style, you got style)\nYou got style (You got style, baby)\n(You got style, you got style) Yeah, oh…\n(You got style) Baby, hey\n\n"
