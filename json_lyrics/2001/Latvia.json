Don´t know, last night was great\nBut something’s screwin’ me up, I swear to God I will stop\nToo much, too much, too much I say\nMy life, it looks like cabaret\nToo much, too much, too much, enough\nI swear I’ll never use that stuff\nOh, baby, take me back (Okay)\nOh, give me one more smile (All right)\nYou’re mine and only one (We’ll see)\nWhy, darling, you don’t come?\nThe day after marriage I went in the streets with my bride\nShe wants a cup of tea. Oh no, I’m voting for beer\nYou see how good is she – my caring, lonely fiancée\nWe walked again the bar through light (Through light)\nOh God, there’s girls from last night\nToo much, too much, too much I say\nMy life, it looks like cabaret\nToo much, too much, too much, enough\nI swear I’ll never use that stuff\nOh, baby, take me back (Okay)\nOh, give me one more smile (All right)\nYou’re mine and only one (We’ll see)\nWhy, darling, you don’t come?\nOh, baby, take me back\nPlease, baby, take me back\nGive me, give me one more chance, give me one more chance\nCome on, baby, one more chance, give me one more chance\nToo much, too much, too much I say\nMy life, it looks like cabaret\nToo much, too much, too much, enough\nI swear I’ll never use that stuff\nOh, baby, take me back (Okay)\nOh, give me one more smile (All right)\nYou’re mine and only one (We’ll see)\nWhy, darling, you don’t come?\nOh, baby, take me back (Okay)\nOh, give me one more smile (All right)\nYou’re mine and only one (We’ll see)\nWhy, darling, you don’t come?\n"
