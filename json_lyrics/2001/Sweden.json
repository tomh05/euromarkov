  "lyrics": "\nI wanna know what you feel inside\nIs something wrong? Why did you leave last night?\nIs it all just a game?\nOh, tell me why we can’t be lovers\nI do believe in the two of us\nThat you and me, we are the only ones\nAnd we were meant to be true\nSo tell me why we can’t be lovers\nHow could I be such a fool\nI thought I already knew it all\nBut I know I was totally wrong\nListen to your heartbeat, it will take you higher\nFollow your emotions, I know you’ll get stronger\nListen to your heartbeat, the feeling will guide you\nHold on to devotion, I know it’s inside you\nHow will I know if you’re fooling me?\nMaybe I’m wrong, but it seems to be\nLike it’s all just a game\nAnd I just want us to be lovers\nWe had it all in our hands\nJust like those all happy ends\nI still don’t know why, but we lost it somehow\nListen to your heartbeat, it will take you higher\nFollow your emotions, I know you’ll get stronger\nListen to your heartbeat, the feeling will guide you\nHold on to devotion, I know it’s inside you\nOne more chance to make a try\nNothing left to do for you and I\nListen to your heartbeat, it will take you higher\nFollow your emotions, I know you’ll get stronger\nListen to your heartbeat, the feeling will guide you\nHold on to devotion, I know it’s inside you\nListen to your heartbeat\n"
