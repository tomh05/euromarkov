  "lyrics": "\n\nTonight the rain is falling, I’m feeling cold\nAnd I’m out of my mind without you\nMy head is spinning like a top\nBack to the time we had a lot going on\nNow my world lies shattered\nHow quickly life can change\nI always did everything for you\nI gave you my heart, you gave me yours too\nYou’d make me feel I was really someone\nBut there’s one thing I should’ve done\nOne day you think you have it all\nThe next you’re staring at the wall, in a dream\nThe road that once was paved with gold\nHas turned a rusty shade of all the saddest colours in the world\nNow my life’s in tatters\nHow quickly it all can change\nI always did everything for you\nI gave you my heart, you gave me yours too\nYou’d make me feel I was really someone\nBut there’s one thing I should’ve done\nI should’ve been there for you\nI should’ve been there for you\nI should’ve been there for you\nI should’ve been there\nI didn’t do everything for you\nBut I tried so hard, and that’s the truth\nI’d make you feel you were really someone\nBut there’s one thing I should’ve done\nI nearly did everything for you\nBut I broke your heart, now mine’s broken too\nIn your hour of need, I didn’t come\nThat’s the one thing I should have done\n\n"
