  "lyrics": "\n\nIn a shadowy world lived a dazzling girl\nUnaware of the light she’d imprisoned inside\nTook a million mistakes to lead her to daybreak\nBut she made it through, now I know the truth\nBeauty never lies, never hides, never gives a damn\nBeauty never lies, no, it cries: “Here I am”\nFinally I can say, yes, I’m different and it’s okay\nHere I am\nHad to shatter the fears laughing in the mirror\nUndermining me, now at last I see\nBeauty never lies, never hides, never gives a damn\nBeauty never lies, no, it cries: “Here I am”\nFinally I can say, yes, I’m different and it’s okay\nHere I am, here I am\nBeneath the veil of skin my heart’s entangled in\nBeauty’s embodied\nBeneath the mask of shame, my soul is set aflame\nBeauty never lies\nBeauty never lies\nFinally I can say, yes, I’m different and it’s okay\nHere I am, here I am\n\n"
