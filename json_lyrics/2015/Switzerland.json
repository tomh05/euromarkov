  "lyrics": "\n\nI’ve been walking in the darkness\nAlways hiding from my true self\nAfraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes\nA wounded ego, not afraid to start a fight\nI’ve been walking on a lonely road\nSo many stories I have once been told\nNo matter what they say I will follow my heart\nI think it’s time for me to stand up and hold my ground\n‘Cause I’m living my dreams, I’ve never been so alive\nThe sky’s the limit now that I know I can fly\nNo more pulling me down, no more mucking around\nI’m growing up, I’m growing up and it’s my time to shine\nYeah, it’s my time to shine\nIt doesn’t matter if I’m wrong or right\nI’m getting stronger every time I try\nI’ve learnt to let it go, taking one step at a time\nI’ve mend my ego, now it’s time for me to let it shine\n‘Cause I’m living my dreams, I’ve never been so alive\nThe sky’s the limit now that I know I can fly\nNo more pulling me down, no more mucking around\nI’m growing up, I’m growing up and it’s my time to shine\nYeah, it’s my time to shine\nIt’s my time to shine\nI’ve been walking in the darkness\nAlways hiding from my true self\nI’ve learned to let it go (I’ve learned to let it go)\nI’ve learned to let it go (I’ve learned to let it go)\nI’ve learned to let it go, now it’s my time to shine\n‘Cause I’m living my dreams, I’ve never been so alive\nI’m living my dreams… (The sky’s the limit now that I know I can fly)\nOoh… (No more pulling me down, no more mucking around)\nHey hey, I know (I’m growing up, I’m growing up and it’s my time to shine)\n(‘Cause I’m living my dreams, I’ve never been so alive)\nI’ve never been so alive, alive (The sky’s the limit now that I know I can fly)\n(No more pulling me down, no more mucking around)\n(I’m growing up, I’m growing up and it’s my time to shine)\nIt’s my time, ooh…\nYeah, it’s my time to shine\n(It’s my time to…) It’s my time to shine\n(It’s my time to, my time to…) It’s my time to shine\n\n"
