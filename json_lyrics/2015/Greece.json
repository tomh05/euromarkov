  "lyrics": "\n\nMy soul, I guess I’m just no one\nYou killed me and I’m done, without a gun\nMy light will fade, I feel betrayed\nJust can’t be brave without faith\nHow could you leave?\nI’m begging you, take me wherever you have gone\nCome back and save me, don’t want to be alone\nNothing left, I just have one last breath\nI’m begging you, take me out of this fiery hell\nCome back and save me, what happened wasn’t fair\nNothing left, all that I have is one last breath\nOnly one last breath\nJust pain, fake love and drunken lie\nI struggle to survive, I’m still alive\nI’m fighting tears and fears apart\nBut still it’s dark inside my heart…\nI’m begging you, take me out of this fiery hell\nCome back and save me, what happened wasn’t fair\nNothing left, all that I have is one last breath\nOnly one last breath\nI’m begging you, take me wherever you have gone\nI’m begging you, take me, don’t wanna be alone\nAll that I have is one last breath\nOne last breath\n\n"
