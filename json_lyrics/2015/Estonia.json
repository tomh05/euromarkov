  "lyrics": "\n\nI woke up at 6am\nMy eyes were closed but my mind was awake\nPretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace\nGot dressed so quietly\nI was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door\nAs I got outside I smiled to the dog\nI didn’t wanna wake you up\nMy love was never gonna be enough\nSo I took my things and got out of your way now, girl\nWhy didn’t you wake me up\nI’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop\nLet’s try again and say goodbye\nGoodbye to yesterday\nWhy would you think like that?\nYeah we fight a lot but in the end\nYou and I, we’re a perfect match\nI wouldn’t want it any other way\nBut now you’re gone and I’m all alone\nLying here naked and staring at the phone\nI didn’t wanna wake you up\nMy love was never gonna be enough\nSo I took my things and got out of your way now, girl\nWhy didn’t you wake me up\nI’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop\nLet’s try again and say goodbye\nGoodbye to yesterday\nI didn’t wanna wake you up\nMy love was never gonna be enough\nSo I took my things and got out of your way now, girl\nWhy didn’t you wake me up\nI’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop\nLet’s try again and say goodbye\nGoodbye to yesterday\nGoodbye to yesterday\nGoodbye to yesterday\n\n"
