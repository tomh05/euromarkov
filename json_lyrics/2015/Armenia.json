  "lyrics": "\n\nWe find so many ways of fooling our heart\nPlaying too many games, trying to hide\nWhen you follow your dream, surrender the sorrow inside\nFace every shadow you denied\nFeels like so many times life was unfair\nWill you run and forget all the despair?\nIf it’s breaking you down, remember the power inside\nFace every shadow you denied\nTime is ticking and you keep thinking\nThat you are tricking your heart\nSo don’t deny\nEver, don’t deny\nBaby, don’t deny\nYou and I\nCross the ocean of blues, happy you’ll be\nOnce you’ve risen you are meant to be free\nWhen you’re feeling afraid remember there’s hope inside\nFace every shadow purified\nTime is ticking and you keep thinking\n(Time is ticking, thinking)\nThat you are tricking your heart\nSo don’t deny\nEver, don’t deny\nListen, don’t deny (I don’t want to deny)\nYou and I\nDon’t deny\nEver, don’t deny\nListen, don’t deny (Listen)\nDon’t deny you and I\n\n"
