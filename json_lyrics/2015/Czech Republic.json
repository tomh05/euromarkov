  "lyrics": "\n\nWait for me, don’t cross the sea of pain\nWait for me, I’m lost, I’ve gone astray\nRavens calling my name, their wings so dark\nSoon they’ll take me away, I have their mark\nThey never miss their prey\nThere is no light to pray for\nCold and dim are the skies\nWounded, lying, running out of life\nOut of life\nIn your eyes I could see\nOur hopes and our future\nNow we must let go\nFind me where the night turns into day\nTurns into day, your love as a torch shows us the way\nThe way how to be whole again\nThere is no light to pray for\nCold and dim are the skies\nWounded, lying, running out of life\nOut of life\nIn your eyes I could see\nOur hopes and our future\nNow we must let go\nMust let go, must let fade away\nOr we can rise and fight\nFor a light to live for\nFire in our hearts\nThrough our pain, through all the\nAll the lies\nWe will walk, walk reborn\nHope never dies\nNever let me go\nNever let me go\n\n"
