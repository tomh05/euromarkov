  "lyrics": "\n\nMet in the dark of night, you’re my lucky strike\nCrazy kids without a clue\nHanging from our knees in the willow trees\nEasy like the month of June\nA fairytale gone right with no end in sight\nHad me tangled up in blue\nYou say we never change, but maybe we do, ooh…\nBaby, this is all we ever used to know\nBut I can see your colours change to red and gold\nEvery moment will hurt, from the last to the first\nI’m trying to find a way to breathe\nClose the book and the chapter forever and after\nI’m falling like the autumn leaves\nMy heart is beating like a million drums\n‘Cause you’re the ground under my feet\nAnd I’m trying to hold on but baby, I’m falling free\nLike the autumn leaves, ooh…\nLike the autumn leaves, ooh…\nBaby, this is all I ever had to know\nNow I can see your colours change to red and gold\nEvery moment will hurt, from the last to the first\nI’m trying to find a way to breathe\nClose the book and the chapter forever and after\nI’m falling like the autumn leaves\nMy heart is beating like a million drums\n‘Cause you’re the ground under my feet\nAnd I’m trying to hold on but baby, I’m falling free\nLike the autumn leaves, ooh…\nLike the autumn leaves, ooh…\n\n"
