Baby, won’t you come back?\n(Baby, please come back)\n(Baby, please come back)\n(Baby, please come back)\nI know you will come with the speed of the light\nYou’re my everything, all that I need\nYou shut down my dreams, but I’m not gonna cry\nYou live within me, that’s why I’m alive\nI am alive, ’cause you are my life\nYou are my sun\nI am alive, ’cause you are my life\nYeah…\n(I know you will come with the speed of the light)\nYou’re my everything, you’re all that I need\nYou shut down my dreams, but I’m not gonna cry\nYou live within me, that’s why I’m alive\nI am alive, ’cause you are my life\nYou are my sun\nI am alive, ’cause you are my life\n(Ay yi yi yi yi yi…)\n(Yeah yeah yeah…) You are my life\n\n"
