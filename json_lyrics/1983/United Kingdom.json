  "lyrics": "\nI don’t believe in idle gossip\nThe jealous mind can be unfair\nI hear them make their accusations\nBut baby, come what may, no matter what the people say\nI’m never givin’ up, not givin’ in\nIf there’s the slightest chance that I could win\nThe battle may be lost, but I can win the war\nAnd get your lovin’ back the way it was before\nAt times it’s hard to see the changes\nOr read the writing on the wall\nWe may become the best of strangers\nBut I’ll keep holding on until I know my chance has gone\nI’m never givin’ up, not givin’ in\nIf there’s the slightest chance that I could win\nThe battle may be lost, but I can win the war\nAnd get your lovin’ back the way it was before\nNever givin’ up, I’m never givin’ up\nI’m never givin’ up, not givin’ in\nIf there’s the slightest chance that I could win\nThe battle may be lost, but I can win the war\nAnd get your lovin’ back the way it was\nI’m never givin’ up, not givin’ in\nIf there’s the slightest chance that I could win\nThe battle may be lost, but I can win the war\nAnd get your lovin’ back the way it was before\nNever givin’ up, I’m never givin’ up\n(I’m allowed to… all I want to… need your lovin’)\nI’m never never givin’… never never givin’… never givin’ up\n"
