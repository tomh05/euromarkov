  "lyrics": "\n\n(We’re gathered here today)\nSometimes we open a door to hope\nThen baby we’re hopin’ the door won’t close\nWe look all around, our future is standing there\nCan’t you see you’re my future?\nWe really get along\nJust like the sun goes with the sunshine\nLike a grape goes with a grapevine\nBut you think in a blink that I’ll be bad to you\nIf you wanna have some fun, don’t run\nDon’t walk away when I’m your summer sun\nIf you wanna know real love and have some fun\nHmm… then baby don’t run\nI know your history makes you shy\nOh baby, it’s no mystery why you fly\nI’m not like the girls, the girls who just come and go\nAnd with me you won’t go solo\nWe really get along\nJust like the stars go with the starshine\nLike a ring goes with a bell chime\nBut you say I won’t stay, you think I’ll pull away\nIf you wanna have some fun, don’t run\nDon’t turn away from me when I am the one\nI’m the one who shakes your clouds away\nWhenever rainy days make you insane\nIf you wanna have some fun, don’t run\nDon’t walk away when I’m your summer sun\nIf you wanna know real love and have some fun\nHmm… then baby don’t run\nI’ll even walk you to the moon\nWalk down the beach all afternoon\nI just wanna be your friend for fun, fun, fun\nIf you wanna have some fun, don’t run\nDon’t walk away when I’m your summer sun\nI’m the one who shakes your clouds away\nWhenever rainy days make you insane\nIf you wanna have some fun, don’t run\nDon’t walk away when I’m your summer sun\nIf you wanna know real love and have some fun\nHmm….then baby don’t run\n"
