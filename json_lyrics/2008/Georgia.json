  "lyrics": "\n\nLook, the sky is crying cold bitter tears\nWeeping for the people lost in fear\nWhile we fight for nothing, my eyes run dry\nAre you still so blind to ask me why? Why?\nSay it out loud: peace will come\nEverybody, shout: peace will come\nWhen you stop and tame your rage\nSomething’s gotta change, something’s gotta change\nSay it out loud: peace will come\nEverybody, shout: peace will come\nBlow the trumpet, beat the drum\nPeace will come\nSometimes words kill faster than bullets do\nBut the face of war is never true\nKids with guns are always too young to die\nAre you still so deaf to ask me why? Why?\nSay it out loud: peace will come\nEverybody, shout: peace will come\nWhen you stop and tame your rage\nSomething’s gotta change, something’s gotta change\nSay it out loud: peace will come\nEverybody, shout: peace will come\nBlow the trumpet, beat the drum\nPeace will come\nMy land is still crying, torn in half\nMy world is slowly dying, my heart is only crying\nPeace and love, oh no, no, no\nSay it out loud: peace will come\nEverybody, shout: peace will come\nWhen you stop and tame your rage\nSomething’s gotta change, something’s gotta change\nSay it out loud: peace will come\nEverybody, shout: peace will come\nBlow the trumpet, beat the drum\nPeace will come\nBlow the trumpet, beat the drum\nPeace will come\n"
