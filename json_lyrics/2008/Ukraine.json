I wanna make you wonder\nRollin’ steady – I’m gonna make you shiver\nMy heart is burning\nShady lady – I’m gonna strike like thunder\nAre you ready? I wanna make you wonder\nRollin’ steady – I’m gonna make you shiver\nMy heart is burning now\nJust take a look at me deep inside and you’ll see\nAll I kept under cover\nThere is one thing I bet you’re about to regret\nI’m no longer your lover\nI’ve just turned one more page\nI belong to the stage\nBaby, don’t call me baby\nShady lady – I’m gonna strike like thunder\nAre you ready? I wanna make you wonder\nRollin’ steady – I’m gonna make you shiver\nMy heart is burning now\n(Shady lady)\n(Shady lady)\nI wanna light you up and leave you alone\nI am a brand new star that you’ve never known\nI wanna light you up and leave you alone\nI am a brand new star that you’ve never known\n(Shady lady)\n(Are you ready?)\nShady lady – I’m gonna strike like thunder\nAre you ready? I wanna make you wonder\nRollin’ steady – I’m gonna make you shiver\nMy heart is burning now\nAni Lorak’s Eurost☆r Page\n\n\n"
