  "lyrics": "\nI spent my days in vain just waiting\nFor happiness to come my way\nI took for granted all they gave me\nI opened my eyes, finally I realised\nThis is my life, I don’t wanna change a thing\nThis is my life, all the pain, all the joy it brings\nAll through the years of blood, sweat and tears\nHopes and my fears, all that was meant to be\nThis is my life, what will be, will be\nThere’s no denying all the heartaches, mmm…\nWere just a blessing in disguise, oh\nIf I never made a single mistake\nOh, I wouldn’t be here, part of the plan I believe\nThis is my life, I don’t wanna change a thing\nThis is my life, all the pain, all the joy it brings\nAll through the years of blood, sweat and tears\nHopes and my fears, all that was meant to be\nThis is my life, what will be, will be\nI’ve found the key to set myself free\nYou’ll be amazed, ’cause I have the power to change my ways\nThis is my life\nThis is my life, I don’t wanna change a thing\nThis is my life, all the pain, all the joy it brings\nAll through the years of blood, sweat and tears\nHopes and my fears, all that was meant to be\nThis is my life, what will be\nThis is my life\n\n"
