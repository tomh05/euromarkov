You have to discover me\nWhat goes wrong when I am crying\nOr what I want when I’m smiling\nCan you feel it?\nCan you feel it, that I’m not a little girl?\nYou’re misunderstanding my way\nAnd all the roles that I like to play\nMy secret combination – it’s a mystery for you\nUse your imagination, I’m not easy but I’m true\nMy secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard\nTo win a destination in the centre of my heart\nMy secret combination – it’s a mystery for you\nUse your imagination, I’m not easy but I’m true\nMy secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard\nTo win a destination in the centre of my heart\nAn open book\nAn open book, well I’m sorry I am not\nSometimes I’m acting like a lady\nSometimes woman, sometimes baby\nMy secret combination – it’s a mystery for you\nUse your imagination, I’m not easy but I’m true\nMy secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard\nTo win a destination in the centre of my heart\nMy secret combination – it’s a mystery for you\nUse your imagination, I’m not easy but I’m true\nMy secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard\nTo win a destination in the centre of my heart\nMy secret combination – it’s a mystery for you\nUse your imagination, I’m not easy but I’m true\nMy secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard\nTo win a destination in the centre of my heart\nTo win a destination in the centre of my heart\nKalomira’s Eurost☆r Page\n\n\n"
