  "lyrics": "\n\nThe rain has touched my steps, the rain has touched my smile\nI’m going to its depth, it takes me to the sky\nAll the stars are falling down and now I can reach the rainbow\nHold my hand and come with me to my other way of being\nThis is all I mean, be my everything\nAnd remember our dreams together\nThis is all I need, be my everything\nAnd live forever, ever, ever\nAll I need is to find a little place to live\nIn your heart, that’s what I want\nAnd to find the words to say, to find the words I’ve never said\nThe words I need to touch your world and your life, to breathe your soul\nA century is now not enough for your love\nThis is all I need\nThis is all I mean, be my everything\nAnd remember our dreams together\nThis is all I mean, be my everything\nAnd live forever, ever, ever\nAll I need is to find a little place to live\nIn your heart, that’s what I want\nAnd to find the words to say, to find the words I’ve never said\nThe words I need to touch your world and your life, to breathe your soul\nA century is now not enough for my love\n"
