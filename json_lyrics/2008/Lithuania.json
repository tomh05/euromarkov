  "lyrics": "\n\nThrough passing days, I close my eyes and feel silk burning me\nYour skin, those gorgeous lips I’ve kissed so long ago\nTonight I’ll try to rip out this aching heart, it’s filled with you\nIt’s filled with lonely pain – obey\nMoon, I follow you in darkness\nIt seems we’re nomads in the night\nYour cold turns me into the heartless\nUntil the sunrise burning light\nBrings down her sky blue shining eyes\nThis hollow day, like days before I walk through thousand smiles\nAnd try to find the look that heals all wounds inside\nBut still I’m here at the world’s edge falling like stone to you\nShining so high, alone – like me\nMoon, I follow you in darkness\nIt seems we’re nomads in the night\nYour cold turns me into the heartless\nUntil the sunrise burning light\nSeems we’re nomads in the night\nYour cold turns me into the heartless\nUntil the sunrise burning light\nBrings down her sky blue shining eyes\n"
