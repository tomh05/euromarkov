  "lyrics": "\n\nSomeone’s selling garden roses down the square\nPeople gathering by to breathe the morning air\nBut no one sees the bitter cold and shivering empty hands\nA school girl running by and trying to beat the bell\nPeople dropping, tossing coins in wishing wells\nBut no one cares for dreams that don’t fit into our world\nMaybe nightfall darkens skies\nAnd maybe teardrops stain our eyes\nBut may the slightest light start a fire\nA soldier in the hands of a forgotten mess\nDigging out the burning bullets in his chest\nSo eager, bold and noble – printing footsteps on this earth\nMaybe nightfall darkens skies\nAnd maybe teardrops stain our eyes\nBut may the slightest light\nStart a fire, start a fire\nBut may the slightest light start a fire\n\n"
