  "lyrics": "\n\nSay no, let go, keep your breath as the anger flows\nI know, you know, words can hurt, you’ll regret them though\nSo say, say, say, say you’ll be there when the words are done\nDon’t give in your pride\nKeep calm and think twice\nFree your mind from the doubts that are tickling\nFree your heart and let the peace enlighten your feelings\nSun will rise and the light will be clearing\nThe tides of the night\nKeep calm and think twice \nSay no, let go, night will fade and the day will glow\nI know, you know that the morning is brighter so\nPlease say, say, say, say you’ll be there when the words are done\nDon’t give in your pride\nLet go and don’t cry\nFree your mind from the doubts that are tickling\nFree your heart and let the peace enlighten your feelings\nSun will rise and the light will be clearing\nThe tides of the night\nKeep calm and think twice\n(Wait a tick, tiny tick, you’ll regret it) Just wanna make it right\n(Wait a tick, tiny tick, you’ll forget it) I wanna let it out\n(Anything isn’t it, you want to get it)\nMaybe tomorrow will be late to get by\nFree your mind from the doubts that are tickling\nFree your heart and let the peace enlighten your feelings\nSun will rise and the light will be clearing\nThe tides of the night\nKeep calm and think twice\n(Don’t give in your pride) Oh…\n(Keep calm and think twice)\n(Don’t give in your pride) Oh…\nKeep calm and think twice\n\n"
