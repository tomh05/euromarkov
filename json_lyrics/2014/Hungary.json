  "lyrics": "\n\nSilent cries every night\nThis pain don’t ever leave her life\nDaddy’s home, so she tries to hide\nShe calls for Mom, but never a reply\nShe cries, cries, cries, she’s all alone\nDaddy, why, why, why? Leave me alone\nShe calls for help, she calls for help but no one seems to care\nShe calls for help but no one seems to care\nShe keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life\nShe keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light\nI can see the angels standing by your side\nIt’ll be alright\nShe’s back again, just one more time\nJust wants to see her mother smile\nShe can’t forget her only child\nMama let the devil in her house\nShe cries, cries, cries, she’s all alone\nDaddy, why, why, why? Leave me alone\nShe calls for help, she calls for help but no one seems to care\nShe calls for help but no one seems to care\nShe keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life\nShe keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light\nI can see the angels standing by your side\nIt’ll be alright\nShe keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life\nShe keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light\nI can see the angels standing by your side\nIt’ll be alright\nShe cries, cries, cries\nDaddy, why, why, why?\nShe keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life\nKeeps on running, running, running\nOh it’ll be alright\n\n"
