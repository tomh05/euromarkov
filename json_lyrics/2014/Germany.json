  "lyrics": "\n\nIs it right? Is it right?\nIs it right? Is it right?\nHe’s got a pen in his hand\nA piece of paper staring back\nHe could run like a man\nAnother life, back on track\nMaybe a drama or a poem\nBut still he doesn’t, no\nThe time is ticking in his ear\nThe lonely silence disappears\nIs it right or is it wrong?\nI can’t go on, you can’t go on\nIf you say yes or even no\nYou don’t know how and where to go\nIs it right or is it wrong?\nI can’t go on, you can’t go on\nIf you say yes or even no\nYou don’t know how and where to go\nIs it right? Is it right?\nShe turns over and looks at him\nShe tries to feel; she can’t feel anything\nBut it’s so hard to say goodbye\nWhen you know that it’s right\nSo when it’s all not what you thought\nAnd the friendship is not enough\nWhen you long to feel alive\nAnd the take the chance to give it up\nIs it right or is it wrong?\nI can’t go on, you can’t go on\nIf you say yes or even no\nYou don’t know how and where to go\nIs it right or is it wrong?\nI can’t go on, you can’t go on\nIf you say yes or even no\nYou don’t know how and where to go\nI know it’s not easy to decide\nTo find your own direction\nOh the reach is high\nBut you can’t hide\nIs it right? Is it right?\nIs it right or is it wrong?\nI can’t go on, you can’t go on\nIf you say yes or even no\nYou don’t know how and where to go\nIs it right or is it wrong?\nI can’t go on, you can’t go on\nIf you say yes or even no\nYou don’t know how and where to go\nIs it right or is it wrong?\nI can’t go on, you can’t go on\n\n"
