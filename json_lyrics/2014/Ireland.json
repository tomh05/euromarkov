  "lyrics": "\n\nWhite lightning upon us again\nThe walls’ now paper-thin\nAnd soon the sun’s breaking in\nDon’t you know? Know\nHow the world is not always true\nStill my truth will remain in you\nWe’ll be braver when we start anew\nI know, I know\nOoh, when the ocean’s way too deep\nKeep your head high above the water\nWe can make it and break the border\nHold on to my heartbeat\nMy heartbeat, my heartbeat\nFace the danger and face tomorrow\nYou’re a dreamer and you don’t know\nThat no story’s carved in stone\nJust hold on to my heartbeat, my heartbeat\nThe ground may be caving in\nAnd some wounds, they may never mend\nBut we will rise up and try again\nI know, I know\nOoh, when the shore is hard to see\nKeep your head high above the water\nWe can make it and break the border\nHold on to my heartbeat\nMy heartbeat, my heartbeat\nFace the danger and face tomorrow\nYou’re a dreamer and you don’t know\nThat no story’s carved in stone\nJust hold on to my heartbeat, my heartbeat\nKeep your head high above the water\nWe can make it and break the border\nHold on to my heartbeat\nMy heartbeat, my heartbeat\nFace the danger and face tomorrow\nYou’re a dreamer and you don’t know\nThat no story’s carved in stone\nJust hold on to my heartbeat, my heartbeat\n\n"
