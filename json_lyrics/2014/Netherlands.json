  "lyrics": "\n\nDriving in the fast lane, counting mile marker signs\nThe empty seat beside me keeps you on my mind\nLivin’ in the heartache was never something I pursued\nI can’t keep on chasing what I can’t be for you\nOoh skies are black and blue\nI’m thinking about you\nHere in the calm after the storm\nTears on the highway, water in my eyes\nThis rain ain’t gonna change us, so what’s the use to cry?\nI could say I’m sorry, but I don’t wanna lie\nI just wanna know if staying is better than goodbye\nOoh skies are black and blue\nI’m thinking about you\nHere in the calm after the storm\nOoh after all that we’ve been through\nThere ain’t nothing new\nHere in the calm after the storm\nMaybe I can find you down this broken line\nMaybe you can find me, I guess we’ll know in time\nOoh skies are black and blue\nI’m thinking about you\nHere in the calm after the storm\nThere ain’t nothing new\nHere in the calm after the storm\n\n"
