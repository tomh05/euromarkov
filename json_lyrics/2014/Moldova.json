  "lyrics": "\n\nWhat am I? Am I human?\nWhat am I? An emotion?\nTime and space can lie to us while we sleep\nLovers cry, parents tremble\nWhile you and I show our devils\nThe world can play a joke on each of us anytime\nMercy\nI have no feelings of mercy\nDestiny left me so empty\nEmpty in my heart and my spirit\nMy patience\nFighting with our indifference\nFighting to win over everything\nThat we are and can be\nSelfishness takes the trophies\nHonesty wins the glories\nAll the masks we have are meant to make us free\nWounded pride kills our feeling\nWhile you and I need the dreaming\nThe world can throw a dice for each of us anytime\nMercy\nI have no feelings of mercy\nDestiny left me so empty\nEmpty in my heart and my spirit\nMy patience\nFighting with our indifference\nFighting to win over everything\nThat we are and can be\nWild soul is rushing through my body\nAnd my wild soul is meant to keep me trying\nMercy\nI have no feelings of mercy\nDestiny left me so empty\nEmpty in my heart and my spirit\nMy patience\nFighting with our indifference\nFighting to win over everything\nThat we are and can be\n\n"
