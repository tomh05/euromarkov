  "lyrics": "\n\nLooking for a candidate\nYou have an option, only one choice\nSipping my drinks, looking around\nThere’s so much beauty, oh yes we can\nBut yet self-confidence is a fragile concept\nThat often fades away in the night\nAnd there it comes, that unwanted guest\nThere is no place for you tonight\nWant me to go, want me to go\n‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying\nNo, open the door\n‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no\nLike an evil satellite\nTwisting the truth then leaving us alone\nIn this mad and moody world\nSociety without love\nI state my heart has been well trained\nI’m gonna be your candidate\nI am the hunter and you are the prey\nTonight I’m gonna eat you up\nWant me to go, want me to go\n‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying\nNo, open the door\n‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars\nI press my nose to the glass\nIt’s raining outside, it’s raining outside\nI would like to storm in\nRoar like a lion, roar like a lion\nBut I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement\nI’m so wet, I’m dirty\nBut I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement\nIt’s me and my imperfection\nWant me to go, want me to go\n‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying\nNo, open the door\n‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no\nWant me to go\n‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying\nNo, open the door\n‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no\nWant me to go\n‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying\nNo, open the door\n‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no\n\n"
