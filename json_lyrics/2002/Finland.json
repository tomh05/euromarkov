  "lyrics": "\nYou don’t know how I was then\nAll broken up, my pride was stolen\nI lived a little lie\nI wouldn’t show the hurting inside \nI was livin’ in emptiness, I was out of love\nGuard my heart, my wall was so high\nYou came in with all your confidence\nYou swept me away off the ground, you taught me to fly \nHolding on until the next time, I can’t get you out of my mind\nIf you were a drug, I’d be addicted to you\nEvery time that we say ‘goodbye’, I just die a little inside\nHow’d I fall so hard? – I’m so addicted to you \nAddicted to you, addicted to you\nSo addicted to you, I’m so addicted to you, oh… \nWhy couldn’t this be simple?\nWe’d live just like the other people\nNow that you’re far away\nMy missing is a constant heartache \n‘Cause those sparkles back in my eyes\nI wish I could stay just like this, don’t want you to go\nWhen you’re far away, fantasize\nThat you’re in my arms and I jump when I hear the phone \nHolding on until the next time, I can’t get you out of my mind\nIf you were a drug, I’d be addicted to you\nEvery time that we say ‘goodbye’, I just die a little inside\nHow’d I fall so hard? – I’m so addicted to you \nAddiction – it’s hitting hard\nNow it’s got its hold\nOh… I can’t let go \n(Holding on until the next time) I can’t get you out of my mind\nIf you were a drug, I’d be addicted to you\nEvery time that we say ‘goodbye’, I just die a little inside\nHow’d I fall so hard? – I’m so addicted to you \nHolding on until the next time, I can’t get you out of my mind\nIf you were a drug, I’d be addicted to you \n"
