  "lyrics": "\n\nWe are behaving like two strangers in the gloomy night\nWe have lost so many feelings in this endless fight\nIf you want to go away, now I must obey\nBut for my part, you’ll remain always in my heart\nTell me why we have to say goodbye\nWas our love only a foolish lie?\nTell me why your eyes are cold and dry?\nNo more tears, no more fears\nNothing more to share together\nIf you want to go away, now I must obey\nBut for my part, you’ll remain always in my heart\nTell me why we have to say goodbye\nWhy we broke our wings in flight\nTell me why couldn’t we just try\nTo forgive and believe we can reach the sky?\nTell me why we have to say goodbye\nWas our love only a foolish lie?\nTell me why your eyes are cold and dry?\nNo more tears, no more fears\nNothing more to share together\nTell me why?\n"
