  "lyrics": "\n\nI’d like to go away, but it’s easier to say\nThat you know all the tricks that make, that make me stay\nI’m ready to support this artful game you always play\n‘Cause you don’t know the fee that you will later, later pay\nToday you think you are the winner\nToday you think you are the king\nYou make me sweat in my emotions\nUnder your fly-away, fly-away wing\nI wanna be the sunshine in your arms\nI wanna be the light from shooting stars\nI wanna be the queen in your sweet lies\nI wanna be the love-spark in your eyes\nI wanna be the sunshine in your arms\nI wanna be the light from shooting stars\nI wanna be the queen in your sweet lies\nI wanna be the love-spark in your eyes\nAy ay ay ay ay ay… \nI like a simple game, but it’s just easier to say\nThat you own all that rules your crazy, crazy way\nAnd even though you’ll go on doing whatever, whatever you may\nJust remember – it’s me who find you when, when you was stray\nToday you think you are the winner\nToday you think you are the king\nYou make me sweat in my emotions\nUnder your fly-away, fly-away wing\nI wanna be the sunshine in your arms\nI wanna be the light from shooting stars\nI wanna be the queen in your sweet lies\nI wanna be the love-spark in your eyes\nI wanna be the sunshine in your arms\nI wanna be the light from shooting stars\nI wanna be the queen in your sweet lies\nI wanna be the love-spark in your eyes\nI wanna be the sunshine in your arms\nI wanna be the light from shooting stars\nI wanna be the queen in your sweet lies\nI wanna be the love-spark in your eyes\nI wanna be the sunshine in your arms\nI wanna be the light from shooting stars\nI wanna be the queen in your sweet lies\nI wanna be the love-spark in your eyes\nAy ay ay ay ay ay…\n"
