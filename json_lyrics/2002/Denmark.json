  "lyrics": "\nMorning light breaking darkness, bringing dawn on again\nI can feel you are restless, I’m afraid for day to begin\nYou are here, still around me, but your mind goes runnin’ free\nTell me who you are, show me what to do\nLet me be the one that you hold on to\nOpen up your heart, let me look inside\nBaby, we’ll go wrong if you try to hide\nSo tell me who you are\nNot a word, not a whisper, I’m confused, feelin’ low\nIn my dreams – sweet surrender, through your arms – like a river I flow\nYou are here, still around me, but your mind goes runnin’ free\nTell me who you are, show me what to do\nLet me be the one that you hold on to\nOpen up your heart, let me look inside\nBaby, we’ll go wrong if you try to hide\nSo tell me who you… tell me who you are\nYou are here, still around me, but your mind goes runnin’ free, oh…\n(Tell me who you are, show me what to do)\nTell me who you are\n(Let me be the one that you hold on to)\nLet me be the one you hold on to\n(Open up your heart, let me look inside)\nOpen up your heart and let me look inside\n(Baby, we’ll go wrong if you try to hide)\nBaby, we’ll go wrong if you hide\nTell me who you are, show me what to do\nLet me be the one that you hold on to\nOpen up your heart, let me look inside\nBaby, we’ll go wrong if you try to hide\nSo tell me who you are\n"
