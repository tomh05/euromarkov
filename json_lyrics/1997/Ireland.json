  "lyrics": "\nI saw you at an airport, ticket in your hand\nI got a feeling in my heart I didn’t understand\nSomething in the way you were, something foreign in your eyes\nMade me wish that I could share one moment of your life\nMysterious woman, I wonder, did you see\nThe kind of spell you put on me?\nMysterious woman, I wish I could find the key\nTo the kind of spell you put on me\nThe room was full of faces but you stood out from the crowd\nPeople going places far away beyond the clouds\nWere you from the streets of Paris, or the coast of Italy?\nOr were you from as far away as the gulf of Araby?\nMysterious woman, I wonder, did you see\nThe kind of spell you put on me?\nMysterious woman, I wish I could find the key\nTo the kind of spell you put on me\nDid I imagine you smiled\nOr were my thoughts going wild?\nSuddenly you were going, the speaker called your plane\nThere was no way of knowing if I’d ever see you again\nBut this brief, so brief encounter will always stay with me\nI will always treasure the bittersweet memory\nMysterious woman, I wonder, did you see\nThe kind of spell you put on me?\nMysterious woman, it’ll always be a mystery\nThe kind of spell you put on me\n"
