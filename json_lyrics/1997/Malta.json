  "lyrics": "\n\nEach time I hear the music play\nIt makes me feel that way\nThe memories we once shared come back inside me\nAnd when I hear that same old song\nThroughout the whole night long\nThe pains that we’ve been through all fade away\nLet me fly and I will reach way up high\nI will climb the steps that lead to the sky\nWhere the clouds caress your face with my tears\nLet me try – I can fly\nLet me hear the songs that I never played\nI will find the keys that open the gate\nOf my dreams, which light the flame in my life\nIf they die, I can’t fly\nHahah, hahahah\nHahah, hahah, hahah\nAnd when the music stops to play\nThe thrill soon fades away\nDark shadows from the past will haunt my day\nLet me fly and I will reach way up high\nI will climb the steps that lead to the sky\nWhere the clouds caress your face with my tears\nLet me try – I can fly\nLet me hear the songs that I never played\nI will find the keys that open the gate\nOf my dreams, which light the flame in my life\nIf they die, I can’t fly\nTill I die, let me fly\n"
