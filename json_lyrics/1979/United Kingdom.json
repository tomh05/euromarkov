I’m gettin’ out of my mind\nI’ve gotta get to you\nShe was in black lace, come back to my place\nCome for a drink and a dance\nBoy, I found she didn’t hang around\nI didn’t stand a chance\nShe paid a big rent\nFor an apartment uptown One-twenty-one\nShe said: come inside, I’ve got nothin’ to hide\nI only want some fun\nHavin’ a good time, walkin’ a tight line\nI was out of my head\nJust when I reached for you, like I usually do\nI found her instead\nMary Ann, I’m gonna do what I can\nBut I can’t do more than try\nTearin’ my heart out tryin’ to make it up to you\nMary Ann, I’m gonna do what I can\nThat’s truth, and that’s no lie\nCryin’ my eyes out, gotta get it back with you\nI woke up early with everythin’ blurry\nAnd my head rattled with pain\nEven so, I heard the doorbell go\nAnd someone call my name\nThere was her best friend, down for the weekend\nI knew I’d met her before\nShe said: you dirty man, when I see Mary Ann\nI’m gonna tell her the score\nMary Ann, I’m gonna do what I can\nBut I can’t do more than try\nTearin’ my heart out tryin’ to make it up to you\nMary Ann, I’m gonna do what I can\nThat’s truth, and that’s no lie\nCryin’ my eyes out, gotta get it back with you\nOut on a late night, way after midnight\nArmed with a bottle or two\nWhat’s the time? I’m gettin’ out of my mind\nI’ve gotta get to you\nMary Ann, I’m gonna do what I can\nBut I can’t do more than try\nTearin’ my heart out tryin’ to make it up to you\nMary Ann, I’m gonna do what I can\nThat’s truth, and that’s no lie\nCryin’ my eyes out, gotta get it back with you\nCryin’ my eyes out, gotta get it back with you\n"
