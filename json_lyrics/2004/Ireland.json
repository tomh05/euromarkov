  "lyrics": "\nI could see my future\nWhen I’m looking in your eyes\nAnd I can sense security\nJust by you being in my life\nI hear a voice inside my head\nSays you’re an angel in disguise\nWithout you I feel hopeless\nWithout you I’m deprived\nI wish I could describe it\nAll the love I feel inside\nMaybe I can find the words\nThat would make you realize\nMy life seems near perfect\nWhen I got you in my arms\nThat’s when I feel wholesome\nThat’s when I am with you\nIf my world stopped turning in the morning\nAnd if God should take this all away\nIf it all should stop without a warning\nI would still stand tall, ’cause behind it all\nYou’re the one who’s made a winner out of me\nI lie alone to touch you\nAnd it comes as a surprise\nThat we spend so long apart\nEven more that I survived\nIf I could speak frankly\nThere’s one thing I can say\nThat I’m falling for you, baby\nFalling further every day\nAnd if my world stopped turning in the morning\nAnd if God should take this all away\nIf it all should stop without a warning\nI would still stand tall, ’cause behind it all\nYou made me your winner\nIf my world stopped turning in the morning\nAnd if God should take this all away\nIf it all should stop without a warning\nI would still stand tall, ’cause behind it all\nYou’re the one who’s made a winner out of me\n"
