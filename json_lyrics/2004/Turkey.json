Do you want?\nUp, I wanna bring you up, up\nI wanna bring you up\nPlease, please, no questions, no answers\nNo more running around in circles\nAre you in? Are you out? Do you know your way out?\nLet me take you up in the sky\nFor real, I’m for real\nCome on up\nI wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up\nI wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up\nDo you want? Do you want?\nUp, I wanna bring you up, up\nI wanna bring you up\nI wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up\nI wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up\nDo you want? Do you want?\nUp, I wanna bring you up, up\nI wanna bring you…\nCome on, come on\nRisin’ up now, risin’ up now\n"
