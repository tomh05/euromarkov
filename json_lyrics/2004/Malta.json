  "lyrics": "\n\nLook at me, I need some attention\nI’m a girl of serious intention\nJust like a butterfly, my wings can take me high\nTo touch your piece of sky\nThough I can fly away, play cool or run away\nI choose to hold your love more than one night\nYou’re everything and nothing in one (What do you mean?)\nOur love goes from the north to the south (I disagree)\nI just can’t understand anymore\nWhat we have in common\nOn again, off again, like the rhythm of rain\nWe need to decide, find an end to this game\nSuch wonderful times, many natural highs\nLove is a flame that we can never tame\nOn again, off again\nWhy, oh, why can’t I live without you?\nHow, oh, how do I reach inside you?\nMy love is justified, I simply had enough\nI want you by my side\nAm I your fantasy, mystery or destiny?\nDo you take me for a ride? Please, tell me now\nYou’re the air, you’re the love that I breathe (That sounds so good)\nYou’re the magic that flows from within (I feel that too)\nWe come close, then we move far away\nCan’t we stay together?\nOn again, off again like the rhythm of rain\nWe need to decide, find an end to this game\nSuch wonderful times, many natural highs\nLove is a flame that we can never tame\nOn again, off again\nThere’s a river between us\nAnd I need you to come across\nReach out for my heart\nKeep this feeling so alive\nLove grows, we survive\nOn again, off again like the rhythm of rain\nWe need to decide, find an end to this game\nSuch wonderful times, many natural highs\nLove is a flame that we can never tame\nOn again, off again\nOff again, on again like a flickering flame\nThat dies in the wind and lights up again\nSuch wonderful times, many natural highs\nLove is a flame we can never tame\nOn again, off again\nOn again, off again\n"
