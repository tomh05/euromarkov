  "lyrics": "\nHow strange the feeling in your soul\nWhen love invades your very being\nAnother “me” or so I’m told\nAnd life takes on another meaning\nDay after day, I go through the motions\nStumbling my way, life is a blur\nSlave of my love, of my emotions\nYou’re in my eyes, you’re in my heart\nOne kiss, one heart, in time\nA kiss, the moment, is mine\nI close my eyes, I breathe\nI’m queen of the world of make believe\nYou make me feel, a little crazy\nYou make me see, your tears are true\nYou make my days and nights so hazy\nYou make me feel the image of you\nYou make me feel, a little crazy\nYou make me see, your tears are true\nYou make my days and nights so hazy\nYou make me feel the image of you\nYou make me feel, a little crazy\nYou make me see\nOne kiss, one heart, in time\nA kiss, the moment, is mine\nI close my eyes, I breathe\nI’m queen of the world of make believe\nYou make me feel, a little crazy\nYou make me see, your tears are true\nYou make my days and nights so hazy\nYou make me feel the image of you\nYou make me feel, a little crazy\nYou make me see, your tears are true\nYou make my days and nights so hazy\nYou make me feel the image of you\nYou make me feel, a little crazy\nYou make me see, your tears are true\nYou make me feel, image of you\nI know, it’s just, a dream\nI feel, l love, this life\nI know, it’s just, a dream\nI feel, l love, this life\n"
