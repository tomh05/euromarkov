  "lyrics": "\n\nI saw my ID and it wasn’t me\nIt was someone else’s identity\nWhy do I need to prove myself?\nWho is the judge of my sanity?\nRoaming through my old emotions\nI find new feelings of misery\nI bet with my soul to get back the truth\nWhere I will face reality\nLife is a book and you gotta read it\nLife is a story and you gotta tell it\nLife is a song and you gotta sing it\nYou got to know how to live it\nLife is a book and you gotta read it\nLife is a story and you gotta tell it\nLife is a song and you gotta sing it\nYou got to know how to live it\nWalking around with some thoughts on my mind\nI’ve searched for a place where I’ll be free\nFrom all that I said and all that’s been done\nIt’ll be hard to find it inside of me\nLife is a book and you gotta read it\nLife is a story and you gotta tell it\nLife is a song and you gotta sing it\nYou got to know how to live it\nLife is a book and you gotta read it\nLife is a story and you gotta tell it\nLife is a song and you gotta sing it\nYou got to know how to live it\nI know that I’ve gotta try\nNo one can see me cry\nI can’t take it any more\nI must find a way to let myself go\nLife is a book and you gotta read it\nLife is a story and you gotta tell it\nLife is a song and you gotta sing it\nYou got to know how to live it\nLife is a book and you gotta read it\nLife is a story and you gotta tell it\nLife is a song and you gotta sing it\nYou got to know how to live it\nLife is a book and you gotta read it\nLife is a story and you gotta tell it\nLife is a song and you gotta sing it\nYou got to know how to live it\n"
