  "lyrics": "\nYou came along and touched my life with summertime\nAnd filled my soul with rays of golden sunshine\nYou made me feel that somethin’ real was waiting to be found\nChanging my whole style, teaching me to smile\nEvery day, every way, let me stay in your summer\nSummer, stay with me\nKeep me warm, summer wine\nKeep me warm, summertime\nI feel the warmth of summer deep inside of me\nAnd know the glow of love will show and free me\nAnd when you’re gone, I’ll carry on with what you left in me\nSomething that will grow, everyone will know\nEvery day, every way, let me stay in your summer\nSummer, stay with me\nKeep me warm, summer wine\nKeep me warm, summertime\nI hope you’ll be returning when next summer comes\nThen we’ll be three, together in the summer sun\n"
