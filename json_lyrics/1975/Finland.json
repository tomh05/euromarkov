  "lyrics": "\nThe door opens wide – every head turns round to stare\nHe steps inside with raindrops on his hair\nA grey old man with legs a-limping, he finds himself a chair\nThen he lifts a fiddle and bow with gentle care\nAnd just like sunlight out of the rain, old man fiddle’s come to play again\nAnd light this night up into flame\nJust his dancing fiddling bow brings to life all sleepy toes\nIn this old heart till morning glows\nSo kiss the blues goodbye\nLet the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly\nFeet are dancing free in ragtime reverie\nPick up your lazy legs and give it a try\nWe sang along into the dawn till our cares were just memories\nDanced in time to country tunes\nIn some valley he lives free, where his notes ripen on the trees\nUnderneath the harvest moon\nSo kiss the blues goodbye\nLet the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly\nFeet are dancing free in ragtime reverie\nPick up your lazy legs and give it a try\nIn the gentle falling rain, you could still hear the loving sound\nThat filled the night with memories\nAnd when the skies are turning grey, bring him back here to play again\nHe’ll waken blossoms on the trees\nSo kiss the blues goodbye\nLet the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly\nFeet are dancing free in ragtime reverie\nPick up your lazy legs and give it a try\n"
