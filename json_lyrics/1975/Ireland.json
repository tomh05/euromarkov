  "lyrics": "\nWhen you’re lonely, when you’re blue\nWhen you need someone to talk to, when you need a talkin’ to\nAnd when troubles full and plenty come pilin’ at your door\nThat’s what friends are for\nLadies and gentlemen of the whole wide world\nIf every now and then a single voice was heard\nTelling it like it should be, makin’ it simple and plain\nIf that man needs a helpin’ hand, help him in from the rain\nNow I know you, know you well\nAnd I know that you’ve been worryin’, it’s not hard for me to tell\nBut I’m standin’ right beside you, of that you can be sure\nThat’s what friends are for\nLadies and gentlemen of the whole wide world\nIf every now and then a single voice was heard\nTelling it like it should be, makin’ it simple and plain\nIf that man needs a helpin’ hand, help him in from the rain\nSo remember, take your time\nJust be sure and let it harmonise, yeah be sure and let it rhyme\nI might call on you to see me through, so open up your door\nThat’s what friends are for\nThat’s what friends are for\n"
