  "lyrics": "\nIf things shouldn’t go right\nYour stars are not twinkling so bright\nDon’t cry, for what’s the use\nTo be counting your blues?\nJust say you had a date\nAnd your friend turned out to be late\nCheer up, think it’s a boon\nGo on, whistle a tune\nNothing will change what had to be done\nIt just happened to be\nPack your troubles and make fun\nYou’ll enjoy it, you’ll see\nSo do listen to me\nWhatever your trouble may be\nJoin in and come along\nWith a smile and a song\nIt’s good to understand\nThat the world is not at its end\nForget what beats you inside\nKeep it out of your mind\nNothing will change what had to be done\nIt just happened to be\nPack your troubles and make fun\nYou’ll enjoy it, you’ll see\nSure love not to be hurt\nWe were born to live on this Earth\nSo when something goes wrong\nJoin in singing this song\nSure love not to be hurt\nWe were born to live on this Earth\nSo when something goes wrong\nJoin in singing this song\nJoin in singing this song\n"
