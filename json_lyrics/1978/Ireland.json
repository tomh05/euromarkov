  "lyrics": "\nI said: “It would never work”, you said: “Let us try”\nI said: “I’m a travelling man who will only make you cry”\nAnd when the feeling hit me and I had to move along\nYou said: “You were right, I guess, you must sing your song”\nAnd a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing\nAnd I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings\nAnd I missed you in the morning, but most of all at night\nAnd I couldn’t stop the music, though I tried with all my might\nI lie in bed and watch the shadows moving on the wall\nAnd the loneliness is killing me, so I turn the radio on\nAnd I need you now, I want you in the slow morning light\nAnd the music makes it easier, but it doesn’t make it right\nAnd a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing\nAnd I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings\nAnd I missed you in the morning, but most of all at night\nAnd I couldn’t stop the music, though I tried with all my might\nSome day I hope you will understand why I live this way\nSongs keep moving in my head, this music I must play\nSo I pack my bags and once again I get out on the road\nAnother day, maybe tonight, I might catch my soul\nAnd a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing\nAnd I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings\nAnd I missed you in the morning, oh but most of all at night\nAnd I couldn’t stop the music, though I tried with all my might\nAnd a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing\nAnd I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings\nAnd I missed you in the morning, oh but most of all at night\nAnd I couldn’t stop the music (Couldn’t stop the music)\nNo, I couldn’t stop the music\nBecause I… hey, I was born… born to sing…\nBorn to sing… born to sing… born to sing…\n"
