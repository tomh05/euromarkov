Your…\nKisses for me, save all your kisses for me\nBye bye, baby, bye bye\nDon’t cry, honey, don’t cry\nGonna walk out the door\nBut I’ll soon be back for more\nKisses for me, save all your kisses for me\nSo long, honey, so long\nHang on, baby, hang on\nDon’t you dare me to stay\n‘Cause you know you’ve got to save your…\nKisses for me, save all your kisses for me\nBye bye, baby, bye bye\nDon’t cry, honey, don’t cry\nWon’t you save them for me\nEven though you’re only three?\n"
