  "lyrics": "\nThe birds have known the old man for many years\nHis eyes have seen so much and look so mild\nHe’s up at four and early every morning\nHe feeds them and feels happy like a child\nOnce he was a clown in the arena\nPeople said the best that ever was\nNow they call him good old Djambo Djambo\nBut in his dreams, he still hears the applause\nHey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo\nDon’t be sad, for you know that the show must go on\nHey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo\nIt was you who had us laughing, you’re the one\nAnd sometimes you can see him on the sidewalk\nWith little boys and girls around his feets\nWhen Djambo Djambo plays his barrel organ\nChildren call it circus in the streets\nSuddenly his eyes reflect emotion\nIn Djambo’s mind, the limelight shines again\nHe’s back on stage and all the kids are laughing\nJust as if the show would never end\nHey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo\nDon’t be sad, for you know that the show must go on\nHey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo\nIt was you who had us laughing, you’re the one\nHey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo\nDon’t be sad, for you know that the show must go on\nHey hey hey… hey hey hey… Djambo Djambo\nIt was you who had us laughing, you’re the one\nIt was you who had us laughing, you’re the one\n"
