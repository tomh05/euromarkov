  "lyrics": "\nI used to love watching beautiful girls go by in my time\nYou have done like the boys do, but now finally you are mine\nLet bygones be bygones, now I love you\nYou gave me more than a man can ever dream, know what I mean?\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nThat’s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nGive me shivers all down my spine… ay ay ay…\nYou are not a moment’s playmate\nYou are the man of my life\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nThat’s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…\nI used to worry so much about all kinds of little things\nNow it is easy to laugh and to dance when it really swings\nNow we’re together forever, I know\nPlaying the games that two people only play when they’re in love\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nThat’s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nGive me shivers all down my spine… ay ay ay…\nYou are not a moment’s playmate\nYou are the man of my life\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nThat’s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nThat’s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nGive me shivers all down my spine… ay ay ay…\nLet your hip go hippety pump pump\nThat’s the way we dance till we die\n"
