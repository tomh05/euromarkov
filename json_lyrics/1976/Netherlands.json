  "lyrics": "\nThe lights are low, the party’s goin’ on\nAnd he who’s mine, he doesn’t seem to miss me\nI feel alone, I think that I’ll go home\nBut if I stay, at least I hear him\nThe party’s over now, the party’s over now\nAt least I dream it’s over now\nHe’s sittin’ next to me and we do both agree\nOur life ain’t bad at all\nYes, the party’s over now\nOne of those bad dreams\nSuddenly came over me\nBut now I feel at ease\nThe lights go out, the party’s goin’ on\nAnd he who’s mine seems really to enjoy it\nI hear him whisper sweet words, but not to me\nI wonder, am I really dreamin’?\nThe party’s over now, the party’s over now\nAt least I dream it’s over now\nHe’s sittin’ next to me and we do both agree\nOur life ain’t bad at all\nYes, the party’s over now\nOne of those bad dreams\nSuddenly came over me\nBut now I feel at ease\nYes, the party’s over now\nOne of those bad dreams\nSuddenly came over me\nBut now I feel at ease\n"
