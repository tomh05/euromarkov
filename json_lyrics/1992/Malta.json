  "lyrics": "\nLittle child, your look – it pains me\nIt’s an answer your eyes seek\nCan’t you see what shadow of a soul\nI’ve come to be tired of the scene\nLittle child, come sit beside me\nIt’s so much I have to say\nStay as free as high winds on the seas\nNo destiny bringin’ lonely tears\nSmile, live today, and leave the past behind\nLive it up day by day, and surely you may find\nThat both sorrow and tomorrow aren’t worth a thought or two\nLook at me and teach me to live again\nLittle child, your look elates me\nIt’s an answer your eyes give\nNow, you see, I’m on the road again\nI’m bringin’ out what child there’s in me\nSmile, live today, and leave the past behind\nLive it up day by day, and surely you may find\nThat both sorrow and tomorrow aren’t worth a thought or two\nLook at me and teach me to live again\nLive again\nSing, live today, this moment can’t endure\nOh, let us reach for the stars – we’ll make it, I’m that sure\nBe it sadness, be it gladness, we can start it all anew\nLook at me, look at me, and the sun comes shining through\n"
