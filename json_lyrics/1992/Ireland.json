  "lyrics": "\nSometimes I watch you passing by my window\nAnd sometimes I watch you passing through my dreams\nAnd sometimes, when I look at you\nYou take my breath away\nSometimes I try and understand your reasons\nYou choose to feel the way you feel about me\nAnd sometimes, when I turn around\nAnd you’re there, like today\nI wanna say:\nWhy me?\nI look at you and I get to feeling, why me? (Why me? Ooh…)\nI know it’s true but I can’t believe it\nI keep on wonderin’ why my love shines in your eyes\nWhy me?\nI look at you and I ask myself, why me?\nSometimes I lie awake and watch you sleeping\nAnd listen to the beating of your heart\nAnd sometimes, when you’re lyin’ there\nYou take my breath away\nAnd I wanna say\nWhy me?\nI look at you and I get to feeling, why me? (Why me? Ooh…)\nI know it’s true but I can’t believe that it’s me\nWho’s gonna be holdin’ you in my arms tonight\nAnd why it’s me who’s gonna be the one to make you feel all right tonight\nWhy me?\nI look at you and I get to feeling, why me? (Why me? Ooh…)\nI know it’s true but I can’t believe it\nI keep on wonderin’ why my love shines in your eyes\nWhy me?\nI look at you and I ask myself, why me?\nWhy me?\n"
