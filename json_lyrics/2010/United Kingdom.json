  "lyrics": "\n\nHow do I begin to imagine\nAll the happy faces I’d like to see?\nThe final destination\nWith sounds of celebration\nIf I could find the opportunity\nSo I wonder, who can I turn to?\nWho can make these wishes and dreams come true?\nAnd with you there beside me\nAnd loving hands to guide me\nAnything is possible to do\nSo if you bring the sunshine\nI’ll bring the good times\nJust add your laughter, it’s happy ever after\nI don’t know about you, but that sounds good to me\nI can feel it coming together\nAll the loving working so very well\nThere’s nothing left to do now\nI’m gonna see it through now\nAnd we can let the future write itself\nSo if you bring the sunshine\nI’ll bring the good times\nJust add your laughter, it’s happy ever after\nI don’t know about you, but that sounds good to me\nWhoa… (Oh whoa whoa yeah…)\nYou bring the sunshine\nI’ll bring the good times\nJust add your laughter, it’s happy ever after\nI don’t know about you, but that sounds good to me\nI don’t know about you, but that sounds good to me\nThat sounds good to me\n\n"
