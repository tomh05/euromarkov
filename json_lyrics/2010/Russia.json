I’m looking at her photos\nWhat should I do with them? (Drop them to the fire)\nOh, yes, yes, I’m gonna burn them now\n‘Cause I have to forget her now with all\nAll of those kisses and sweet embraces\nHere am I, lost and forgotten for this cruel, cruel time\nWhen I’m first time in love (Now that is why)\nNow that is why I sing, Lord of Mercy\nAnd I hope now that you hear me, oh…\n(Here am I, lost and forgotten for this cruel, cruel time)\n(First time in love, now that is why)\nNow that is why I sing, Lord of Mercy\nAnd I hope now that you hear me\nOh, bring her back to me\n\n"
