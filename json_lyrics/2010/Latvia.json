What for are we crying?\nWhat for are we dying? Only Mr God knows why\nWhat for are we living? What for are we dreaming?\nWhat for are we losing? Only Mr God knows why\nBut his phone today is out of range\nThe sun in colour black is rising high\nThe time is turning back, I wonder why\nSo many questions now with no reply\nWhat for do people live until they die?\n(What for are we living?) What for we’re living?\n(What for are we crying?) Crying\n(What for are we dying?) Dying\n(Only Mr God knows why) Mr God knows why\n(What for are we living?)\n(What for are we dreaming?) Dreaming\n(What for are we losing?)\nOnly Mr God knows why\n\n"
