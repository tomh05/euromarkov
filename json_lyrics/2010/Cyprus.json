  "lyrics": "\n\nTime changes everything, even you and I have changed\nThe rain, the winter spring has made us fade away\nI still remember everything, that ol’ December, the fears, the cold\nI really wonder how you feel on these nights so alone\nI hope someday you’ll see me\nI hope someday you’ll spot me in the crowd\nTake my hand and kiss me\nI hope someday you’ll say my name out loud\n(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings\nTell me about your stories\nLook into my eyes and come on closer\nAnd make me immortal with a kiss\n(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings\nTell me about your stories\nWe know it’s over, so tell me it’s over\nAnd life will be better in spring\nTime changes everything, but this feeling, it still remains\nThe sweetest ever lips I’ve kissed will always feel the same, ooh..\nI hope someday you’ll see me\nI hope someday you’ll spot me in the crowd\nSmile and say you miss me\nI hope someday you’ll say my name out loud\n(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings\nTell me about your stories\nLook into my eyes and come on closer\nAnd make me immortal with a kiss\n(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings\nTell me about your stories\nWe know it’s over, so tell me it’s over\nAnd life will be better in spring\n(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings\nTell me about your stories\nLook into my eyes and come on closer\nAnd make me immortal with a kiss\n(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings\nTell me about your stories\nWe know it’s over, so tell me it’s over\nAnd life will be better in spring\n\n"
