  "lyrics": "\n\nWe used to say that dreams could be so true\nWhere am I? What will I be?\nIt’s my dream which I could share with you\nA new day for you and me\nJust a smile with warmth in my heart and go all the way\nThere’s so much in life and I’ll sing\nThis is my dream, I want to make it really happen\nAnd make my dream come true\nThis is my dream, I’ll make it if I just believe it\nIn a fairytale I’ll live it, just like a new born star\nFly above like a seagull on the waves\nAnd the sun will shine upon your face\nJust believe, follow your heart and make it happen\nGrow much brighter and we’ll say\nThis is my dream, I want to make it really happen\nAnd make my dream come true\nThis is my dream, I’ll make it if I just believe it\nThere is nothing that could stop me\nI just want the world to know\nThis is my dream, and I know that I’ll be strong\nIt will come true because I know I’ll make it happen\nThis is my dream\n\n"
