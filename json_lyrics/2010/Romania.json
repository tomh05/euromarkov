Are you running away?\nUh ho… uh ho… uh ho…\nBoy, boy, boy, what a fight, come and spend with me the night\nGirl, girl, girl, are you sure? (Uh-huh) I ain’t here to fight, alright?\nYou and I could try to stop – uh boy, till you drop\nIf we get together now, we’ll burn this place down\nYou and me, can’t you see, we’re playing with fire\nTell me now, do you feel this burning desire?\nDon’t stop, make it rock, it’s taking us higher\nCould it be just a dream? Are you running away?\nUh ho… uh ho… uh ho…\nYou and me, can’t you see, we’re playing with fire?\nTell me now, do you feel this burning desire?\nDon’t stop, make it rock, is taking us higher\nCould it be just a dream? Are you running away?\nYou and me, can’t you see, we’re playing with fire?\nTell me now, do you feel this burning desire?\nDon’t stop, make it rock, is taking us higher\nCould it be just a dream? Are you running away?\nUh ho… uh ho… uh\nIf we get together now, we’ll burn this place down\n\n"
