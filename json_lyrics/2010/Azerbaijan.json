You smell like lipstick again\nCome on, answer my question, say something\nWhy are you acting out? Oh, say it’s in my head\nCan I love you forever through this?\nCan I trust in you forever through this?\nI don’t know how to stop, how to stop\nThese tear drop-op-ops\nThat drip drop, drip drop\nDrip drop, drip drop\nWhoa, whoa\nI don’t wanna cry, I don’t wanna hear your name\nIf this is where it ends\nI don’t wanna run, run away from myself\nAnd be lost again\n(Can I love you forever through this?)\nOh no no no, oh no no no\n(Can I trust in you forever through this?)\nI don’t know\nThese tear drop-op-ops (I don’t know)\nThat drip drop, drip drop (I don’t know)\nDrip drop, drip drop\nWhoa, whoa\n\n"
