  "lyrics": "\n\nWho can ever tell the colour of a soul\nAnd the memories we keep from long ago?\nDo we ever really know each other’s past?\nYou can’t go back to before\nBut tommorow will bring even more\nLike the tide’s gonna turn you will know\nWhen it’s cold you’re on your own but you’re never alone\nShine, shine like the stars in the sky\nWipe your dust of your love, let it shine\nSo when nothing’s ever really carved in stone\nRemember that your heart is holding on\nAnd when every second melts up in the past\nDon’t be afraid it will end\nOnly fear that it never began\nLike the tide’s gonna turn you will know\nWhen it’s cold you’re on your own but you’re never alone\nShine, shine like the stars in the sky\nWipe your dust of your love, let it shine\nYou can’t go back to before\nBut tomorrow will bring even more…\n(Like the tide’s gonna turn you will know)\nWhen it’s cold you’re on your own but you’re never alone\nShine, shine like the stars in the sky\nLet it shine\n\n"
