I am scared, the boys are insane\nDon’t you dare to say her reaction’s dumb\n‘Cause she had no place to run\nNobody hurt no one\nNobody hurt no one, anybody\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nNobody hurt no one, yeah-eah…\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nYou deny the truth, you’re just having…\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nTill your child will shoot your gun\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nSo please don’t hurt anyone\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nYou deny the truth, you’re just having fun\nTill your child will shoot your gun\nDon’t you dare to say, her reaction’s dumb\n‘Cause she had no place to run\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nNobody hurt no one, anybody\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nNobody hurt no one, yeah, yeah, yeah…\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nSo please don’t hurt anyone\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nAnybody\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nSo please don’t hurt anyone\n(Nobody hurt no one)\nYeah, yeah…\nNobody hurt no one\n"
