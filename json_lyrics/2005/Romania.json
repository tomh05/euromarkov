  "lyrics": "\n\nWhen I find you in my dreams\nYou always try to run away\nIt doesn’t look it, but it seems\nYou still take my breath away\nAnd when I try to ask you why\nWe couldn’t give it one more try\nI can’t find you anywhere\nYou are not there\nLet me try, let me try\nI don’t wanna say goodbye\nI will find a way to make you stay\nJust let me try\nLooking back, I realise\nWe are learning from mistakes\nI can see it in your eyes\nI can feel your heartbeat breaks\nBut when I try to ask you why\nWe couldn’t give it one more try\nI can’t find you anywhere\nYou are not there\nLet me try, let me try\nI don’t wanna say goodbye\nI will find a way to make you stay\nJust let me try\nLet me try, let me try\nI don’t wanna say goodbye\nI will find a way to make you stay\nJust let me try\nLet me try, let me try\nI don’t wanna say goodbye\nI will find a way to make you stay\nJust let me try\nLet me try\nI will find a way to make you stay\nJust let me try\n"
