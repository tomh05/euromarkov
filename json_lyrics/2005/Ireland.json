Can you feel it? Do you think you’re strong enough?\nCan you take the highs? Can you take the lows?\nCan you handle everything love throws?\nLove can build you up, love can tear you down\nLove can change the world, this is what I’ve found\nLove can make you happy, love can make you cry\nLove can be the best until it’s passed you by\n(Love, love, love)\nIf you want it, come and get it, even though you know the score\nI will love you, I will hate you, then I’ll love you even more\nCan you handle love? Can you handle pain?\nCan you handle everything I’m sayin’?\nLove can build you up, love can tear you down\nLove can change the world, this is what I’ve found\nLove can make you happy, love can make you cry\nLove can be the best until it’s passed you by\n(Love, love, love)\nLove will capture you whole with your body and soul\nLove is taking control of your senses\nLove is guilty as tried, love has no alibi\nLove is breaking down all your defences\nLove\nLove can make you sorry, love can make you weep\nLove can take you over even when you sleep\nLove can give you heaven, love can make you high\nLove can make you cheat and love can make you lie\nLove can build you up, love can tear you down\nLove can change the world, this is what I’ve found\nLove can make you happy, love can make you cry\nLove can be the best until it’s passed you by\n"
