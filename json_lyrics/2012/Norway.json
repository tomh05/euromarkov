  "lyrics": "\n\nI hear the music as I walk down the street\nStart moving to the rhythm, heart is pumping the beat\nI hear the people shout out, “Turn up the music louder”\nBetter start running if you can’t stand the heat\nWhat’s it doing to me? I feel it setting me free\nIt’s like I’m losing all control\nYou know it’s making me hot and baby I don’t stop\nIt’s like a fire in my soul\nI don’t know what I’m doing tonight\nBut this rushing is making me stronger\nI don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right\nBut I know I want you to stay\nNananananana stay, nananananana\nHeart beats faster as I stand in the crowd\nMy meters are peaking, I can tell you’re around\nIt’s like I wanna (shout out), nothing can pull me (down now)\nSirens are calling and I can’t kill the sound\nWhat’s it doing to me? I feel it setting me free\nIt’s like I’m losing all control\nYou know it’s making me hot and baby I don’t stop\nIt’s like a fire in my soul\nI don’t know what I’m doing tonight\nBut this rushing is making me stronger\nI don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right\nBut I know I want you to stay\nNananananana stay, nananananana\nWhat can move your body baby?\nYou better, nananananana, you better, nananananana\nCome on now, what can move your body baby?\nYou better, nananananana, you better\nI don’t know what I’m doing tonight\nBut this rushing is making me stronger\nI don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right\nBut I know I want you to stay\nI don’t know what I’m doing tonight\nBut this rushing is making me stronger\nI don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right\nBut I know I want you to stay\nNananananana stay, nananananana\n\n"
