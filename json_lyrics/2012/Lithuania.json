  "lyrics": "\n\nWhen the day becomes the night, you know that I think of you\nAnd I cannot control my heart, it’s crying for you\nLoneliness is killing me, I’m helpless without your love\nKnowing when you touch someone, I can’t understand\nNow it’s tearing me apart, I want you back\nAnd it’s made me realise just what I had\nLove is blind, it’s true, nobody is like you\nMy endless melody I play for me and you\nLove is blind, it’s true, I’m on my knees for you\n‘Cause I’d give it all I can to have you back again\nLove is blind\nI just can’t believe you’re gone and I let it slip away\nI can’t believe I was the one who caused you pain\nI said you should know deep down inside\nShe didn’t mean a thing to me, yeah\nWhat can I do to win back your heart and make you to stay?\nI can’t believe, can’t believe you’re gone\nI can’t believe…\nLove is blind, it’s true, nobody is like you\nMy endless melody I play for me and you\nLove is blind, it’s true, I’m on my knees for you\n‘Cause I’d give it all I can to have you back again\nLove is blind\nLove is blind\n\n"
