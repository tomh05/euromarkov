I can’t let her go\nComing up beneath me\nNever been in love so deeply before\nI am close to the waterline\nI thought that I’d been over my head for the last time\nI’m so close to the waterline\nAnd the way I’m loving her now\nI know this is bound to go down as the big one\nFloodgates, can’t wait\nHere she comes, shut’ em fast\nBetter shut ‘em fast\nToo late, swept away\nFeel the rush\nI am close to the waterline\nAnd the way I’m loving her now\nI know this is bound to go down as the one\nI am close to the waterline\nI thought that I’d been over my head for the last time\nI’m so close to the waterline\nAnd the way I’m loving her now\nI know this is bound to go down as the big one\n\n"
