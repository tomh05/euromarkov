What are you gonna do?\nIf you run here and wait for me now, are we done here?\nOr starting somehow?\nBut what would you do when my house was empty?\nMy life in a bag and away from you\nYou took my love for granted, would you really miss me?\nAny other guy would do, but would you? Would you?\nIt’s a two-way street\nAnd I know that\nBut don’t look back\nStill I wonder, still I wonder\nBut what would you do when my house was empty?\nMy life in a bag just to be with you\nBut when I’m at your door will you say you miss me?\nAny other guy would do\nYeah, other guy would do, but would you?\nBut would you?\nOh would you?\nI love you\n\n"
