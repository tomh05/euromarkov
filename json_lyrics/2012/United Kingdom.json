  "lyrics": "\n\nSo graceful and pure, a smile bathed in light\nNo matter the distance, a miracle of sight\nThough I should have known, I could not turn away\nWhen faced with your beauty no reason can stay\nAs you kiss him in the moonlight\nWith heavy words I say\nIf you love someone, follow your heart\n‘Cause love comes once if you’re lucky enough\nThough I’ll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep\nOnly love can set you free\nTrust in your dreams, run with no fear\nAnd if you should stumble remember I’m near\nAs a ghost I will walk, I’ll look deep in my soul\nI might find another, you gave me that hope\nSo as you kiss him in the moonlight\nWith heavy words I say\nIf you love someone, follow your heart\n‘Cause love comes once if you’re lucky enough\nThough I’ll miss you forever and the hurt will run deep\nOnly love can set you free\nAnd if you love someone, follow your heart\n‘Cause love comes once if you’re lucky enough\nThough I’ll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep\nLove will set you free…\n\n"
