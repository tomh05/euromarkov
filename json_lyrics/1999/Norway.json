It’s you\n(Hey hey… I think I’m going crazy, baby)\n(Hey hey…) Living my life without you\n(Living my life without you – can it be true?)\nSomething is missing, baby\nBaby… (Living my life without you – what) can I do?\nI think I’m going crazy\n(Living my life without you – can it be true?)\nSomething is missing, baby\n(Living my life without you – what can I do?)\n(I think I’m going crazy) I think I’m going crazy\nIt’s you\n"
