Always\n(Saying: “Just be nice, always think twice”)\n(When it’s been a long time since they had a teenage life) Let’s go\n(“What did you learn at school today?”) What did you learn?\n(That’s what the teachers used to say) What did you learn?\n(But they don’t know, don’t understand, do they?)\n(Why do they always give advice?) Always, always\n(Saying: “Just be nice, always think twice”)\n(When it’s been a long time since they had a teenage life)\nDwellin’ on the past, from back when I was young\nThinkin’ of my school days and tryin’ to write this song\nClassroom schemes and dreams, man, they couldn’t save me\n‘Cause my days were numbered when I signed down on Avy\nTeenage kicks running out, what could we do?\nI still show respect to my boys who made it through\nAnd getting told off Mr T how my life would be\nThen giving him a signal, so everyone could see\nSunshine and shade, those girls I’d serenade\nThinkin’ of those sixth form chicks that misbehave (Whatever)\nHopin’ that those days would go on and on forever\nEvery day something new, just friends runnin’ together\nBut suddenly school ends, your teenage life’s gone\nAll your mates are growin’ up, now they’re movin’ on\nAnd now I’m lookin’ back, I’ll tell you what I know\nDo you listen to your teacher? No, I don’t think so\n(“What did you learn at school today?”) Yeah, yeah\n(That’s what the teachers used to say)\n(But they don’t know, don’t understand, do they?)\n(Why do they always give advice?)\n(Saying: “Just be nice, always think twice”)\n(When it’s been a long time since they had a teenage life)\nNow if you give the kids time, together they will shine\nYeah, yeah (Ooh… shine)\nWe all will shine, hear me now\nAnd if you treat the kids fine, they won’t do the crime\nNo, no (Won’t do the crime)\nYeah\nNow my bad old ways were durin’ my school days\nMessin’ with those grade A’s, my life is just a haze\nI’m goin’ through the struggle, five ten and kickin’ back\nSo I could lock the flow, lace it up now on the track\nOh yeah, I felt the pain whilst chasin’ all the fame\nI’m being told I’m nothin’, just a player in the game\nBut now I walk tall, stand proud for you to see\nI’m drivin’ these fast cars, it’s five stars for me\n(“What did you learn at school today?”)\nJust take your turn, you gotta learn\n(That’s what the teachers used to say)\n(But they don’t know, don’t understand, do they?)\nThey don’t know nothin’\n(Why do they always give advice?) Always givin’ advice, yeah\n(Saying: “Just be nice, always think twice”)\n(When it’s been a long time since they had a teenage life)\nYeah, yeah\n(When it’s been a long time since they had a teenage life)\n\n"
