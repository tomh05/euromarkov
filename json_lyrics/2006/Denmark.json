  "lyrics": "\n\nOnce upon a time there was this guy called Johnny\nHe was kinda shy and so in love with Connie\nBut so was O’Smarty, who played it cool\nThe king of the party, but oh what a fool (What a fool)\nHe didn’t know how to twist\nHe didn’t know how to make a girl insist\nHe didn’t know how to move, he didn’t feel the groove\nHe didn’t know how to twist\n(Twist, he didn’t know how to twist)\nHe didn’t know how to move, he didn’t feel the groove\nHe didn’t know how to twist\nOnce upon a night there was this guy called Johnny\nHe was kinda high and dancing with his honey\nThe queen of the party proclaimed him king\nWhile poor old O’Smarty was left in the ring\nHe didn’t know how to twist\nHe didn’t know how to make a girl insist\nHe didn’t know how to move, he didn’t feel the groove\nHe didn’t know how to twist\n(Twist, he didn’t know how to twist)\nHe didn’t know how to move, he didn’t feel the groove\nHe didn’t know how to twist\nHit it, Johnny\nA twist of love, a twist of pain\nA twist of me and you\nA twist of things you can’t explain\nWill make your dream come true\nBe sure you know how to twist\nBe sure you know how to make a girl insist\nBe sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove\nBe sure you know how to twist\nOh… (Twist)\nYeah, twist\nBe sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove\nBe sure you know how to twist\nBe sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove\nBe sure you know how to twist\n\n"
