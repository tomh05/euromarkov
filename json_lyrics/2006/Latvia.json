  "lyrics": "\n\nIn a world that is beeping and blaring\nGrowing louder every day\nI cover my ears\nBut none of the noise will go away (Away)\nSirens, barking dogs\nThank God for the one and only sound\nThat turns around and makes it right\nI hear your heart whisper to me\nNo matter where I may happen to be, yeah\nSending me love and shining it through\nI hear your heart, can you hear mine too?\nI hear your heart whisper to me\nNo matter where I may happen to be, yeah\nSending me love and shining it through\nI hear your heart, can you hear mine too?\nOh, as sensitive people we’re trampled\nAlmost everywhere we go\nThere are days (When we will die) when we’ll die\nIf one more stranger tells us no\nSo I hope your shadows melt away\nAs you say they’ve done before\nJust like the one and only sound\nThat turns around for me once more\nI hear your heart whisper to me\nNo matter where I may happen to be\nSending me love and shining it through\nI hear your heart, can you hear mine too?\nI hear your heart whisper to me\nNo matter where I may happen to be\nSending me love and shining it through\nI hear your heart, can you hear mine too?\nI hear your heart\nMine too?\nI hear your heart\nA violin on a summer night\nOn a full moon mountain top\nCouldn’t sound as sweet as you do\nDon’t stop, don’t stop\nI hear your heart whisper to me\nNo matter where I may happen to be\nSending me love and shining it through\nI hear your heart, can you hear mine too?\nI hear your heart whisper to me\nNo matter where I may happen to be\nSending me love and shining it through\nI hear your heart, can you hear mine too?\n\n"
