  "lyrics": "\nIn the summer nights, when the moon shines bright\nFeeling love forever\nAnd the heat is on when the daylight’s gone\nStill happy together\nThere’s just one more thing I’d like to add\nShe’s the greatest love I’ve ever had\nFly on the wings of love\nFly, baby, fly\nReaching the stars above\nTouching the sky\nAnd as time goes by, there’s a lot to try\nAnd I’m feelin’ lucky\nIn the softest sand, smiling hand in hand\nLove is all around me\nThere’s just one more thing I’d like to add\nShe’s the greatest love I’ve ever had\nFly on the wings of love\nFly, baby, fly\nReaching the stars above\nTouching the sky\nIf you just fly (Fly, baby, fly)\nFly on the wings of love (On wings of love)\nReaching the stars above (Fly, baby, fly)\nTouching the sky\nFly on the wings of love\nFly, baby, fly\nReaching the stars above\nTouching the sky\nFly on the wings of love (Fly, baby, fly)\nFly, baby, fly (On wings of love)\nReaching the stars above (Fly, baby, fly)\nTouching the sky\nIf you just fly\nOn wings of love\n"
