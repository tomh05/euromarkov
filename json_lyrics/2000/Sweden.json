  "lyrics": "\nI am caught in a trap, there is no turning back\nI’m finally facin’ the fear\nThe sky is on fire, and up with the flames\nMy hope and my dreams disappear\nSo bring me the power, I’ll be the king of the land and the seas\nShow me the way to go, let me fight with my body and soul\nLet me be the native son with freedom in my heart\nLife will never be the same when spirits are calling my name\nMy name…\nLet me out of the darkness, the shadow of pain\nAnd I’m keepin’ my promise to you\nMy people, my spirit, the home of my heart\nYou’re with me wherever I go\nSo bring me the power, I’ll be the king of the land and the seas\nI’ve got a way to go, let me fight with my body and soul\nLet me be the native son with freedom in my heart\nLife will never be the same when spirits are calling my name\nMy name…\nSo bring me the power, I’ll be the king of the land and the seas\nI’ve got a way to go, let me fight with my body and soul\nLet me be the native son with freedom in my home\nLife will never be the same when spirits are calling my name\nSpirits are calling my name\n"
