  "lyrics": "\nI’m in love with the place where I was born\nWhere I lived my life in harmony with every new dawn\nI’m in love with the people that I know\nWith whom I share my tears of laughter, the times I feel low\nIt’s a little bit of love, it’s a little love I need\nTo keep me going, keep me smiling\nIt’s love that makes me breathe\nIt may be Finland, France or Spain\nBerlin, Prague or Rome\nIt’s the place where you live\nWhere your heart feels at home\nThere’s a world that is bigger than my own\nWhere they strive to try and unify, to dull monotone\nEvery change that really matters comes from within\nWhen in love we stand together through thick and thin\nIt’s a little bit of love, it’s a little love we need\nTo keep us going, keep us smiling\nIt’s love that makes us breathe\nIt may be Amsterdam or Bern\nSweden or U.K.\nWhere your heart is at home\nYou will feel okay\n(It’s a little bit of love), it’s a little love we need\nTo keep us going, keep us smiling\nIt’s love that makes us breathe\nIt’s a little bit of love, it’s a little love we need\nTo keep us going, keep us smiling\nIt is love that makes us breathe\nTo keep us going, keep us smiling\nIt is love that makes us breathe\n"
