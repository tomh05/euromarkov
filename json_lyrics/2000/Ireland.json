  "lyrics": "\nNature’s child lays beside a mother’s broken heart\nWe stand denied the power and glory\nBitterness can’t feed the hungry, hate just leaves us cold\nIt’s time to change it\nI lit a candle in a dream I thought I heard\nLiberated voices crying freedom\nOpen hearts, open doors in truth and honesty\nLet wisdom be the guiding light\nCelebrate the new millennium of love\nWhere our footprints leave a harvest for the children\nSomewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare\nI believe we all have the answer\nA cloud can hide a mountain\nAnd a face can hide the pain\nSearch until you find the answer\nThere is no reason\nWho can understand man’s inhumanity to man?\nCelebrate the new millennium of love\nWhere our footprints leave a harvest for the children\nSomewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare\nI believe, I believe, I believe, I believe in you\n(Celebrate the new millennium of love)\nLet our footprints leave a harvest for the children\nSomewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare\nI believe we all have the answer\nI believe we all have the answer\n"
