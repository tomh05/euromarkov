  "lyrics": "\nShowing no emotion, my feelings locked inside\nI made myself an island, trying to take my heart and hide\nI built a wall around me, afraid of letting go\nBut suddenly an open door I never saw before\nIn your eyes (Your eyes) I see the light leading me home again\nIt’s heaven in your arms, my love, my heart is in your hands (Heaven in your arms)\nIn your eyes (Your eyes), seems so right, I see forever in your smile\nThis woman is a child again (In your eyes)\nLove’s been building bridges between your heart and mine\nI’m safe here on my island, but I’m out on the edge this time\nI built a wall around me, thought I’d save myself the pain\nYour touch swept me away, now I’ll never play it safe again\nIn your eyes (Your eyes) I see the light leading me home again\nIt’s heaven in your arms, my love, my heart is in your hands (Heaven in your arms)\nIn your eyes (Your eyes), seems so right, I see forever in your smile\nThis woman is a child again\nI’ve never been this close\nHow do I know love will survive?\nI’m walking a tightrope\nHere, in your arms, I’m alive\nI’m in your eyes (Your eyes) I see the light, I see forever in your smile\nThis woman is a child again\nI’m in your eyes (In your eyes I see the light leading me home again)\nI see the light, I see the light\n(It’s heaven in your arms, my love, my heart is in your hands) Whoa…\n(In your eyes, feels so right) I see forever in your smile\nThis woman is a child again when I look in your eyes\n"
