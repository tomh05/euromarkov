I thought I found love\nThis time I’m gonna stand on my own\nI said, now, baby, this time\nI won’t be missin’ you at all\nNo, no, now, baby, this time\nI’ll be strong, I won’t fall in love again\nYou thought I was usin’ your love\nWastin’ all your time, that’s where you were wrong\nOh baby, baby, when I found out\nThat you went wrong with foolin’ around with my little heart\nIt hurt so much, pain unexplained\nHow could you do it when I thought I found love?\nThis time I’m gonna stand on my own\nSaid, now, baby, this time\nI won’t be missin’ you at all\nNo, no, now, baby, baby (This time)\nI’ll be strong, I’ll be strong, yeah\nThis time\nI won’t be needin’ your lovin’ for me, baby\nBaby, babe, baby, I’m gettin’ by\nThis time\nI’ll be strong, I won’t fall in love again\n"
