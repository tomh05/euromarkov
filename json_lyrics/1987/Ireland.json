  "lyrics": "\nDon’t, don’t close your heart to how you feel\nDream, and don’t be afraid the dream’s not real\nClose your eyes, pretend it’s just the two of us again\nMake believe this moment’s here to stay\nTouch, touch me the way you used to do\nI know tonight could be all I’ll have with you\nFrom now on, you’ll be with someone else instead of me\nSo tonight, let’s fill this memory for the last time\nHold me now, don’t cry, don’t say a word\nJust hold me now and I will know\nThough we’re apart, we’ll always be together, forever in love\nWhat do you say when words are not enough?\nTime, time will be kind once we’re apart\nAnd your tears, tears will have no place in your heart\nI wish I… I could say how much I’ll miss you when you’re gone\nHow my love for you will go on and on and\nHold me now, don’t cry, don’t say a word\nJust hold me now and try to understand that\nI hope at last you’ve found what you’ve been searchin’ for\nAnd though I won’t be there anymore I will always love you\n(Hold me now, don’t cry) Don’t say a word\nJust hold me now and I will know\nThough we’re apart, we’ll always be together, forever in love\nWhat do you say when words are not enough?\nWhat can I say? Now my words are not enough\n"
