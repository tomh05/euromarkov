  "lyrics": "\n\nYou made it so easy\nTo fall, I could not stand at all\nI saw you beside me\nYou never saw me there at all\nI promised you all this\nI made plans thinking this was it\nI never imagined\nI’d find you and lose myself instead\nI never had a picture of an end\nAnd I, I wanna believe in love\nI wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us\nI, I wanna breathe again\nI wanna go back to the days, the days I had my innocence\nI wanna believe again\nI picked up the pieces\nAnd put them back where they belong\nBut something is missing\nThough I look the same, I’m not that strong\nBut I’m gonna learn to trust again\nAnd I, I wanna believe in love\nI wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us\nAnd I, I wanna breathe again\nI wanna go back to the days, the days I had my innocence\nI wanna believe again\nFor without love, what do we become?\nI never had a picture of an end\nAnd I, I wanna believe in love\nI wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us\nAnd I, I wanna breathe again\nI wanna go back to the days, the days I had my innocence\nI wanna believe again\n"
