Are they only lies?\nFalling out of a perfect dream\nComing out of the blue\nIs it true? (Is it true?)\nIs it over? Did I throw it away?\nWas it you? (Was it you?)\nDid you tell me you would never leave me this way?\nIf you really knew me, you couldn’t do this to me\nYou would be my friend\nIf one of us is lying, there’s no use in trying\nNo need to pretend\nFalling out of a perfect dream\nComing out of the blue\nIs it true? (Is it true?)\nIs it over? Did I throw it away?\nWas it you? (Was it you?)\nDid you tell me you would never leave me this way?\nIs it true? (Is it true?)\nIs it over? Did I throw it away?\nWas it you? (Was it you?)\nDid you tell me you would never leave me this way?\n(Is it real? Did I dream it?)\nWill I wake from this pain?\nIs it true? (Is it true?)\nIs it over? Baby, did I throw it away?\nIs it true?\nYohanna’s Eurost☆r Page\n\n\n"
