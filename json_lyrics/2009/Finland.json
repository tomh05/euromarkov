  "lyrics": "\n\nI don’t wanna lose control but I’m falling, falling down\nI got this panic emotion that I can not describe to you\nMy world is tumbling down what am I what am I gonna do\nCa-can’t deny it, deny it what am I going through\nCa-can not fight it, can’t fight it now I’m looking for the truth\nI don’t wanna live a lie, checking on my sanity\nCos maybe baby I can do without, is it all a fantasy?\nI don’t wanna live a lie, is this my reality?\nIt’s spinning round and round day and night\nI don’t wanna lose control but I’m falling, I just can’t believe it\nNever thought that I would be the one falling down\nI don’t wanna lose control but I’m falling, I just can’t believe it\nNever thought that I would be the one falling down\nI’m on a critical mission, got my destiny in my hands\nLike peter piper I take control, put a spell on the mass\nI cause hysteria worry yourself that’s how I roll\nIt’s not a drill, I’m for real, I’m a man who’s out of control\nI don’t wanna live a lie, checking on my sanity\nCos maybe baby I can do without, is it all a fantasy?\nI don’t wanna live a lie, is this my reality?\nIt’s spinning round and round day and night\nI don’t wanna lose control but I’m falling, I just can’t believe it\nNever thought that I would be the one falling down\nI don’t wanna lose control but I’m falling, I just can’t believe it\nNever thought that I would be the one falling down\nI’m falling, I’m falling\nAnd I just can’t believe it\nI’m falling, I’m falling down\nI don’t wanna lose control but I’m falling, I just can’t believe it\nNever thought that I would be the one falling down\nI don’t wanna lose control but I’m falling, I just can’t believe it\nNever thought that I would be the one falling down\n"
