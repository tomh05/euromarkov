Oh yeah\nFrom the highest heights of all? Oh yeah\nI climb this tree, the highest heights\nFrom beneath the stars, I see little lights\nThe dreams I dream demand their rights, oh\nWill you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah\nFrom the highest heights of all? Oh yeah\nHow will I ever know?\nI’ve always gotta know\nWill you catch me?\nWill you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah\nFrom the highest heights of all? Oh yeah\nWill you catch me?\n"
