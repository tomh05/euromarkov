  "lyrics": "\n\nEverybody’s sayin’ your love is like a prison\nEverybody’s tryin’ to help me to come free\nEverybody’s talkin’ ’bout all the things I’m missin’\nAnd for all them reasons I must agree\nIt’s too dangerous when we touch\nAnd I love you much too much\nGet out of my life, babe\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my head\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my bed\nIt’s beyond belief, but true\nI became a slave to you\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes\nWhere I lose all of my drive\nWhile I’m fighting to survive\nJust get out of my life\nGet out of my life\nWell, you are like a moonbeam that makes me feel so lonely\nYou are like a mountain and I’m afraid to fall\nEvery time I’m certain you are my one and only\nI know if you leave me, I’ll lose it all\n‘Cause you’re overwhelming me\nYou’re too perfect, can’t you see?\nPlease, get out of my life\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my head\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my bed\nIt’s beyond belief, but true\nI became a slave to you\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes\nWhere I lose all of my drive\nWhile I’m fighting to survive\nJust get out of my life\nBecause I love you\nMore than you will ever know\nWould be hard to let you go\nBut get out of my life\nGet out of my life\nIt’s beyond belief, but true\nI became a slave to you\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams\nJust get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes\nWhere I lose all of my drive\nWhile I’m fighting to survive\nJust get out of my life\nGet out of my way, hey…\nOr just stay\n\n"
