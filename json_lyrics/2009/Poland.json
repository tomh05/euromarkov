  "lyrics": "\n\nI can’t say the words I feel inside so deep\n‘Cause when the clouds come out, I feel so incomplete\nI know the sun shines down on me\nI see it now, the rain won’t get to me\nI just wanna live my life the way it’s meant to be\nI don’t wanna leave, but it’s my destiny\nI will wrap my arms around the world, you’ll see\nThat I am not a child, ’cause I’m standing taller this time\nTake it step by step, do my best, that’s right\nBut I will never say goodbye\nFor so long now I’ve been dreaming in the dark\nI was too scared to feel the things held in my heart\nDon’t you know this is meant to be, I’ll let it out\n‘Cause it’s getting hard to breathe\nI just wanna live my life the way it’s meant to be\nI don’t wanna leave, but it’s my destiny\nI will wrap my arms around the world, you’ll see\nThat I am not a child, ’cause I’m standing taller this time\nTake it step by step, do my best, that’s right\nOh… I don’t wanna leave, I don’t wanna leave\nBut it’s my destiny, oh…\nI’ll never say goodbye…\n(Never say, never say, never say goodbye)\nNever, oh…\n(Never say, never say)\nI don’t wanna leave, but I’m standing taller this time\nTake it step by step, do my best, that’s right\nBut I will never say goodbye\n\n"
