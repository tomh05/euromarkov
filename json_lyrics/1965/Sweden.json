  "lyrics": "\nA night of spring is a lovely thing\nBut I feel sad in this night of spring\nFor this is the time the sloe gets bright\nAnd this is a most bewitching night\nAnd I am lonely and you are far\nAnd you can’t hear what I sing\nI wish I knew where you are tonight\nI wish you’re thinking of me tonight\nWhere are you tonight?\nI wish you feel how I long for you\nAnd I wish you’re missing me too\nAnd I wish I knew where to go\nKnowing you, knowing you\nWe ought to walk where the cowslips grow\nBehind the hedge of candescent sloe\nAnd you ought to smile and look at me\nAnd I ought to kiss you tenderly\nBut I don’t know if you still are mine\nThis lovely evening of spring\nI wish I knew where you are tonight\nI wish you’re thinking of me tonight\nWhere are you tonight?\nI wish you feel how I long for you\nAnd I wish you’re missing me too\nAnd I wish I knew where to go\nKnowing you, knowing you\nTonight\n"
